Imagine there exists a platform A which allows users to
a) book playgrounds and sports pitches 
b) find people who play the same sport in the same city 
c) buy equipment to play their sports.
Build 3 reports in Excel/Google Sheets which you think would be key to track the success of this platform. 

Created Dummy Datasets, for the above criterias. 
And have applied visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries

PS: Results may not be logical and correct but the approch does.
