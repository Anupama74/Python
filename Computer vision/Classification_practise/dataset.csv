Cheaters,ambajirao_a,Bangalore India,1,"Apr 22, 2014 05:22 PM",9558 Views,"Third class service and they are cheaters. Never ever opt for this. While taking money they are not bothered about the identity of person giving money but while refund or surrender of policy they want to communicate with policy owner only and that too with registered mobile number and phone number.
When the policy is surrendered they try to misguide the policy owner by saying that the NAV will increase and cancel the surrendered request and they don't even respond when surrendered the policy second time.
There is no benefit of any of the metlife policy and they just want to make profit from customers money. I was paying premium of Rs 25000 and out of which Rs 3000 is deducted every year from profit which is 12% of invested amount.

"Well, think again!!!!!",deekshasethi,new delhi india,4,"Mar 13, 2006 09:41 PM",3548 Views,"Its true that insurance is a services based industry and that it is very important to know the status of ur plan for a customer but I feel that when a person buys a paln, he sure has a plan and if not, his advisor does. it is entrirely not the responsibility of the company to be update about the clients profile and product status. don u think u should have also thought about it, once before u blasted out on the company?????
well I think u should have and u need to be a lot more careful about ur premium payments because before u start cursing Metlife, all I would like to remind of is the fact that the very reason that privatisation happened was that the services of LIC were not upto the mark. so I mean just give it an honest shot and accept ur side of the fault.
secondly as u said about the flood, well is it not possible that the reminders were also lost in that flood.
thirdly and most importantly, no policy ever lapses by non payment of single premium. so all u have to do is, pay the balance premium and ur policy will be in full force and if u don believe me, ask ur trusted LIC agent and for God's sake, get some knowledge about insurance.

Metlife is the worst insurance company,lijok,Kochi India,1,"Jun 04, 2013 09:08 AM",9311 Views,"I have taken a Metlife policy in 2008 August when the sen-sex was down.
I was planning to put the money as Fixed deposit. But the bank people insist me to take the Metlife policy. They said I need to pay only for three years and after three years the amount will become double. I have invested Rs. 75000 and today, after six years it's value is 71000.
Still,  I thought of taking the amount but they said there is a locking period of 10 years and if I take now, I will get only 54000.
It's very sad that my hard-earned money is with this people.

HAVE U MET LIFE TODAY??????,Kiran4,mumbai india,4,"Oct 14, 2004 02:06 PM",15309 Views,"Scene 1 : A lady weeping besides the dead body of her Husband....her 3yr old son quite oblivious to what had happened just wiping his mothers tears...her 5 yr old daughter cud understand something has happened to her dad..she sits besides him trying to wake him up....
The lady had shared some of her wonderful moment with her hubby but now she will be alone left with the responsibility of the house and her kids...
They had recently bought their house on loan and the installments are still pending...
So many questions come to her mind for which she has no answers....
Can u imagine her condition.....She is just a house wife and she has the following responsibilities on her..
1) To Pay back their housing loan.
2) To have a sound income for the household expenses
3) To accumulate a suitable corpus for her children?s education
4) To accumulate a reasonable corpus for her daughters wedding.
5) To Have a retirement corpus for herself.
Scene 2 :Someone knocks her door..She sees a known face and suddenly she gets relieved of half of her tension?It?s the Insurance agent with whom her hubby used to always discuss about various plans?He had come to her place on hearing about the incident. This agent quickly goes thru his data and asks her to show her all the policies which her hubby had taken. Finally she gets something to bring a smile on her face amongst such trying conditions..She comes to know that her hubby had taken a policy for all her needs..HE had planned it very well and covered Majority of her requirements?
Well this was just an example ..of how worse the situation could be when the main bread winner of the family meets with ill fate of destiny?
Luckily the lady?s husband had a foresight and had planned it well ..But are everyone so foresighted or lucky??
CAN WE TOO BRING A SMILE ON OUR DEAR ONE?S FACE when we are no longer here..Well atleast we can try to..
WE all know what Insurance is ?But its meaning has changed recently?
For Majority of people its just a TAX SAVINGdevice..
For some others its an Investment which covers life also..
For VERY few Insurance means Purely Insurancewith only life cover.
Insurance Basically form three sectors
1) Protection
2) Accumulation
3) Retirement
Protection ensures that your obligations are met in the event of death or disability.
Accumulation involves developing a sound plan to assist you in paying for Education, marriage expenses and buying a Home.
And Retirement provides for additional income to supplement existing Savings and Investments.
The Most important asset we have is our lives and many people don?t bother to have it adequately insured.
There was this amazing statistics Which I came across during my training ..
It said that ?Out of every four people 1 will not see his 60th birthday and the rest three will, but all of them will require Insurance.
Well Now Since I know something about METLIFE INDIA INSURANCEbeing a financial adviser for the same. I would like to discuss a few things about the company as well as the policies.
Ok I will discuss the company and policies to the extent not sounding like a salesperson.
Metlife is an US based company Having its Indian Main office at Bangalore.
Metlife(Metropolitan Life Insurance Company) USA was founded in 1868.
Having 135 years of operations it is the Numero Uno Life Insurance Company in US
Its present in 10 countries across the world as of the recent info which I have.
It?s in the 36th ranking in the fortune 500 companies.
It services 88 of the Fortune 100 companies.
Well U can visit the site  http://www.metlifeindia.com
Well Metlife India is an affiliate of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. It has started its India operations since the last 3-4 years.
The policies which really attracted me much are.
1)Met Ultimate : The best policy any one can have. It?s a policy which covers ones life for 100 years. It?s a master policy and If u Insure urself properly with this plan u don?t have to take any other policy.
Features.
------------
The Premium amount is used to cover your Insurance as well as the company opens an account in your name where a part of the money from the premium is deposited. It just acts like a savings account which attracts a minimum guaranteed interest of 3.5% .
U can also withdraw the sum in ur account after two years.
If u feel the company is paying good returns u can deposit amount in your account whenevr u have excess money.
If u feel u don?t have the money to pay premiums after the first three years u can skip paying premium for a year or two provided your account has got the required amount.
If u feel u wont be able to keep up with the premium u can reduce the Sum Assured after three years.
So u can use this policy as a savings option, As an emergency fund, as a Retirement policy and also as a legacy.
Limitation:
------------
It has a high premium .. A sum assured of 1 lac attracts a premium of about 6,000/- approx. annually for a 26 year old person
2)MetSuraksha TROP:TROP means Total Return of Premium.
Features.
------------
It acts in the same way. This policy can be used to cover once life for 20 years and then get back whatever money he has spent on premium along with a guaranteed 10% bonus, if he survives the policy period. IF he doesnt he gets back the entire sum assured.
The premiums are much lower as compared to MET ULTIMATE.
For a 26 year old a sum assured of 10 lacs attracts a premium of approx . 5000/-annually
Limitation:
------------
No money back in between 20 years except on death of the Insured.
3)Met Bhavishya:This is an ideal policy for Kids. One of the conditions which Metlife places is that Parents also must be adequately insured before insuring their child. This guides the moral aspect as there have been many instances of Parents insuring in the child?s name and practicing some immoral acts.
Met Bhavishya is taken in the name of the parent for the benefit of the kid.
Features.
------------
It properly plans the way in which one should get back their money during crucial period of their kids career.
It has a money back option when the child attains an age of 15,17,20 and further for professional education.
So one can plan their kids education as well as marriage with this policy.
Limitation:
------------
Well the premium is usually high Similar to Met Ultimate.
A 1 lac policy attracts a premium of Rs 6,000 annually.
Either of the parents should be insured with atleast the same amount of sum assured which they plan for their kid to be insured. This is not as such a limitation but a bottleneck for people who just want their kids to be insured and cant afford high premium payment every year.

So far so good,vijayv82,Chennai India,4,"Apr 14, 2011 11:59 AM",4692 Views,"My requirement:
Iam Vijay aged 29. I was looking for a pure term plan as I didn't wanted to mix insurance and investment. I wanted the SI to be ~ 50 L for a term of 30-35 years
My initial research: I explored almost all insurance companies.IRDA annual reports. Started with LIC. LIC is good in terms of claim settlement and reliability, but the premium rates are very high.
I decided to buy a term insurance online since the premium are low. the premium is low thru online because they give the benefit to customers rather than agents taking the commission. LIC doesnt have an online buying option at cheaper rate as metlife, ICICI or KOtak has.
My initial preference was ICICI pru. But I stayed away from it reading the reviews from mouthshut. Looks like some of customers has not even received their policy document. Same issue with KOtak as well. After going thru reviews of metlife, I was convinced to go further.
My online puchase went seamlessly. I went for 55 L cover. After few days I got a call from metlife for medical check up and document collection. Medical chk up happened in my house with no hassle. Then a collection agent came to my place to collect documents. Initially when registering, they only asked for pay slip for income proof. But later, they started asking for ITR froms. Looks like they were not clear about what to collect, this irritated me to some extent. After I gave my scanned copies of ITR, I got my policy doc couriered in 3 days. with policy date commencing from my online registration date. Throughout the process, metlife did several follow-ups with me and showed interest in completing the transaction. I didnt had to bug them at any point of time.As far as the ""range of plan"" metlife has 35 year term plan where no other pvt insurance company has. My experience so far with metlife is better than I expected it would be.
Hope you would find my review useful and thanks to other who have been reviewing in MS. Your reviews helped me not to go in for ICICI / Kotak.

Evaluate carefully before choosing!,IndianReviewer,banglaore india,2,"Feb 24, 2014 12:15 PM",8334 Views,"Evaluate carefully before choosing.
Do not fall for that you have to pay only for 5 years. Because premium is high. For eg. premium for 1 crore cover is 50000 and you pay for 5 years totalizing 2.5 lac.
Now if you take conventional yearly cover for 25 year term, premium is around 12000. Suppose you go for it and you save 38000 every year for 5 years.= 1.9 lac
Now out of this 1.9 lac, if you FD it say at 8-9% approx return yearly= 15000. With that you can pay 12000 yearly as premium and save 3000 every year and invest it.
At the end of term you will have 20*3000= 60000+ compounded interest which will take it well over 2 lakhs. So you end up saving 2 lakhs or more. This is just conservative calculation. You may save more.
So evaluate carefully because I feel normal online term plan is more cost effective.

HEAVY LOSSES ON PNB METSMART PLATINUM- NEVERBUY!!,aggrwalmeha,Delhi India,1,"Sep 09, 2015 02:24 PM",9355 Views,"I am a life insurance policy holder of PNB Metife, policy number- 21389787. Only God knows what is happening with the fund value. My fund value of approx INR 3, 06, 000. After, I have paid my premium of INR 22, 000, the fund value has lowered to 3, 02, 000.
THE CUSTOMER CARE IS NON RESPONSIVE AND RIDICULOUS. ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS IN MY LIFE WAS CHOOSING PNB METLIFE.
They should literally fire all there fund managers and insurance agents. My insurance agent Ms. Ritu Sharma, who sits at PNB Mall Road Branch Delhi, near Vishvavidyalaya Metro Station. misguided me and did not reveal anything about such heavy charges which are levied unnecessarily every month.Never, believe that lady.! She literally lied on my face.
I am disheartened at such negative returns. My policy running under a value of INR 24, 000, even after 15 months of policy issuance.
NEVER GO FOR PNBMETLIFE!
Really disappointed. Their higher authorities should really get a a realty check and FIRE ITS FUND MANAGERS.!
USELESS AND LOSS MAKING POLICY!
STOP PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S HARD EARNED MONEY!

Metlife India Life Insurance premium hassles,gdgupta,Chandigarh India,2,"Jun 08, 2009 06:38 PM",4234 Views,"I would like to share my experience with all you how are planning to take a life insurance policy from METLIFE beware. firstly, the agent don't have proper information about the plans that they are selling this guy came to me with a plan which he didn't knew about, each time I would put a query he will call his boss and take instructions.... secondly, he took an extra amount for the first premium telling me that these are policy charges but to my amazement when next premium renewal letter was received it was mentioned that I have paid that extra premium along with the first premium that that stands adjusted..
Now, Last month I received an SMS from the comapny informing me that my premium has been changed for 1st may onwards. Amazed, I got in touch with the agent and customer care.. The agent said he ahs been promoted to a sales manager rank and is busy to take any calls will ask somebody to get in touch, and till today past 1 month I am still waiting for that person to contact me.. in the meanwihile I worte a mail to customer care
The reply from Mettlife..
""we would like to inform you that the increase in Modal premium is due to service tax applicable on the premium amount. This is in line with Goverment notification dated 10, May 2008, (Notification No. 18/2008), wherein all existing as well as new unit linked policies will attract Service Tax at the rate of 10.30% (inlusive of education cess).""
I replied back with the query that ""why only Metlife has increased the premium...""
Metlife's Reply
""We acknowledge the fact that there has been no cahnge or amendement in the Service Tax nortification Since 01 May 2009.""
What does this comapny thinks of us that we sitting here are fools or something Just want an honest reply from all you, Is it justified to change the premium once you have paid 2 premiums for a life insurance product.

Pathetic Customer Service,kittusvkm,Bangalore Inida,1,"Mar 06, 2007 10:41 PM",4128 Views,"I had taken a ULIP with Metlife last year for 41000/-.  Paid the first premium.  The second premium is due on 31/01/2007.  I have given the cheque to my financial advisor on 14/01/2007.  The cheque got realised after 3-4 days.  But the units are not getting reflecting in my account.  I have called the customer care, the reply was that the units will be bought on premium date i.e on 31/01/2007.  I thought that might be the policy.  On Ist Feb i have checked my account and still the units are not reflecting in my account.  I have called the customer care, the reply was it will happen in 3-4 working days.
After one week, ie in 2nd week of february, I have checked the account and still the units are not getting reflected.  I have the customer care, the answer was pathetic, software has bug and it will take 15 days to resolve that bug.  I don't why that much time it will take.  I have requested the statement, the answer is once the software bug is resolved, then only they can provide the statement.
After 15 days, I have again checked the account, I am surprised that still the account doesnot reflect the latest units.  The customer care have sent mail that we apologize for the inconvenience. Now today also I have checked, the units are not reflecting.  Very Very pathetic customer service.
This I experienced personally, everything written above is true.

Crooks and dangerous,roopamroy,Miamisburg OH India,1,"Jul 26, 2014 03:26 PM",9286 Views,"Only invest in this company if you have sympathy for crooks and criminals since that money will never come back. I believe they are doing business just  to acquire public money and then run away.  My mother invested money for 3 years which was what the agent told her, after which when she wanted to discontinue they would not allow that and kept pursuing her without listening to her.  Finally they applied thousands of unknown hidden cost and service charges and finally she got back only 20% of the principal amount she had invested.
After that their agent calls her after some time and tells her that if she invests more money then they can help her with the injustice done towards her and get back her principal. For that she has to send a cheque of 15000 to some address and sms the cheque no and the DTDC courier number to him, When we questioned him more because we smelled wrongdoing, the agent disconnected. We believe that this was a method employed by metlife to get suck the last possible amount from the investor before shelving his/her record.

Hello,
This is to inform or advise or warn people who are planning to invest in Metlife India.
The surrender value that Metlife charges is 70% of the total premiums paid.
I got this confirmed from Metlife email support but the same is not mentioned while you take up the policy, the terms and conditions does not mention the number 70% as a loss if we surrender before maturity.
Below is the email that I received from Metlife:
Dear Mr. Suman
Greetings from MetLife!
This is with reference to your e-mail, regarding above mentioned policy number. We would like to inform you that as per the product feature, policy acquires a surrender value only if the policy has been in force for at least 3 years - provided all premiums have been paid for 3 full policy years.  If premiums are paid for at least three consecutive years the policy acquires a surrender value which is equal to 30% of the premiums paid excluding the first year premium and extra premiums.
We would like to inform you that we are in receipt of surrender request for the policy and the same has been processed. The surrender amount of Rs.9600 has been credited to your account on 26 June 2012. Please refer the below table for the surrender value calculation for your reference.

"If you have excess money, get drained with Metlife",dayaking,Bangalore India,1,"Apr 08, 2011 11:29 AM",4186 Views,"I had purchased a ""Met-smart"" plan in april 2006. With the advice of RAMESH MANOOR from Metlife.
Initially I had agreed for a policy of 2 lac coverage. At the last minute, he had changed it to Rs 4lac with lot of forceful convincing by luring me with lot of benefits, coverage etc. Ramesh was introduced to me by one of my friend, who was a metlife Agent.
After receiving the policy, I was shocked to know all types of charges, which were never explained to me before I purchased the fund. I am attaching some of the charges as below.
Premium Allocation Charges, Policy Administration Charge, Face Amount Related Charges, Mortality Charge, Unit Adjustment, Service Tax, Additional Cess, Educational Cess, Auto Unit Journal. After all this, the ""Closing Balance"" Balance was pea-nuts.
When I asked about this, to Ramesh, he said, ""it will be there for the first time, but from next premium onwards, the money would grow like anything"".
After the second premium payment, the story was same again. Then he said, ""Nothing to worry, after the first three years, e money would double""
After that he stopped taking my calls, stopped replying to my mails.  There not much to tell about the courtesy of customtakeouter care executives. The online login and account management does not work, as you need to change the password very often and it should include a complex combination of letters, numbers and special characters. You should not re-use the password which was used for last six month / 12 times, whichever is later. So I stopped using the online facility.
If you want to switch the funds, there, you would have to pay again.
All in all, it is not a Mutual Fund, Nor an Insurance policy, but only a money drainer.
After 5 years now, the fund value is less than what I have paid to them. If I want to withdraw/ close the fund value anytime, before 10 years, I have to fore-go a huge percentage of the final NAV.
Never ever plan to but a ULIP [Unit Linked Policy] product. Go for Pure Insurance, or Pure Mutual Fund.
These ULIP people are showing the benefits of Mutual Fund, and Insurance, but they have all the conditions beneath the blanket to siphon-off your money.
Thanks to IRDA for the recent rules and some courtesy towards the poor citizens.
Thanks,

NEVER INVEST. Worst Fund Performance by PNB MetLif,ramireddysaikrish,India,1,"Jun 15, 2016 03:00 PM",11548 Views,"I took  ULIP  Met life met smart  Accelerator fund  in 2006 ==policy number 00203123, ==   from 2006 to 2016( 10 Years) quarterly premium of Rs 8999 . Total investment of Rs 359960 .
Today the fund value  Rs 450000. not even 7 to 8 percent of return, not even Saving deposit returns. they are deducting  unnecessary and huge charges on ULIP products, no transparency in deducting charges and cheating the customers.
My 10 years investment  Returns is not equivalent to Bank deposit. they don’t care their fund returns loses.
Metlife should seriously look into the working of its fund managers and try to improve the fund performance which is consistently worst.
I am  asking PNB
1. Explain me why your funds are not performing as well as your peers in the industry?
2.Your fund managers are responsible for the loss of hard earned money .
3. why you are charges are not transparent?
I know with this review you are not going to change .
I generally don't write reviews but my investment returns with metlife  has forced me to write this review. I thought to share with other persons so they don’t go through the same pain by starting a policy with pnbmetlife.
ADVICE: Choose some other policy that has some credibility and decent track record. DO NOT BUY METLIFE EVER.

"Very bad customer service, bad for online payment",Balakiran,Bangalore India,1,"Jul 20, 2011 06:22 PM",5454 Views,"I had a metlife policy(no:00579074)
I tried to pay online premium of RS 6000/-  twice(2 times) on July 1st 2011, but both the transactions was failed and reasoned as NETWORK DELAY. I tried again on July 2nd 2011 for Rs 6000/- and it was successful.
All the 3 transaction worth each Rs 6000/- and total of Rs 18000/- are deducted from my credit card account.
I waited for one week for the return of excess amount of Rs 12000/- because these is natural for all the online payemts/ transaction. All the failed transactions will usually take 3 to 4 days to return.
But in the case of metlife I am still waiting for my amount even after 20 days.
I tried to contact customer care so many times. but it will never connect to customer representative. it puts you on hold for minutes and says in between all the representatives are busy. after 10 mins call will get disconnected.
So later I wrote a mail to them and explained all the scenario in mail. I got a reply after 4 days and they asked proof for 3 transaction of each 6000. I replied the mail with my credit card statement. later on there is no update, no mail or no phone call from them.
I will see next 2 to 3 days. if I don't get my money back I will raise a cheating complaint with consumer forum.
Thanks & Regards,
Balakiran

Metlife lost Policy. Rrefusing to pay surender Amt,rozariopm,India,1,"Sep 16, 2015 03:52 PM",9332 Views,"We have 2 policies:00110576 & 00111801
We had surrendered our policies on 21 Aug 2015 and got the acknowledgement.
But the company is not settling the amount(more than Rs 10 lacs).
They are behaving like a chit fund company. Never expected this from a Public Sector & Multinational company.
Although I keep telling them repeatedly that the policy is with them, they go no like a broken record ""Submit your policy"".
Does anybody have any suggestion how to get them to settle my account.

Avoid taking any policy from metlife,ajay9331,noida India,1,"Feb 15, 2011 07:49 PM",3244 Views,"I had taken metlife policy from a metlife agent who made me a sheer fool. Its agent tell anything to make you buy the product. I took the policy in 2008 for 50K per annum. its charges are so much that they took my first premium 50K as service charges and they are not stopping here..they are charging around 2K on every premium. so far I have given them 1.5 L but my actual amount which will be invested further is only 90K....i have learnt the lesson hard way..only giving this feedback to make others aware of this loot they are doing openly under the nose of govt.


Choose wisely the plan...do not invest at 11th hour and read the brochure instead of asking the agents..if agent promise you something ask for the written doc on same in policy doc.


If you have taken the policy, read the policy document as soon as you get it..about charges, terms and conditions and all.policy can be terminated within 15 days of when you get the document.

Worst customer support I really see,kmadhuri493,Hyderabad India,1,"Apr 01, 2011 02:58 AM",2741 Views,"I try to open the website but its the worst of the websites. It does not open most of the times. I thought of taking just a printout of the premiums but till now I could not login into the website. Even when I call the customer service regarding this, they say, its down now, u can try later...But, I could not see it UP never and ever.
Regarding my policy..My agent had enabled Auto-debit facility without myself knowing it. As I am near to due date, I paid the premium 1 day in advance feb17th 2011. Again on due date 18th feb 2011, the premium amt got debited.
I am really surprised why this happened and went through the document and came to know that Auto-debit is ON.
Then called Metlife customer service
1) They said..we can see 2 transactions but could not confirm it..may take 1 week time that it gets confirmed. So, after a week they called me back, asked if the amt can be taken as next year's premium.
I said no..and asked for refund of the amount..and they have taken the request and said a cheque will be sent to comm address..I said ok..fine..
2)Later a week, they called me and said..we need account statement and written statement..that too not via mail..to the bank address...
Didn't they know this when I am logging a refund request.. Only after a week, they told me this..
3) ok..I said..and asked that guy..if I can send..auto-debit cancellation letter..(which I have to provide a written stmt) and this refund request in the same courier..The person said fine..u can send both in the same courier..
I have sent both the written statements + acnt statement..in the same courier..march7th....they have cancelled auto-debit..
4) I called Metlife..on March9th and enquired about both..they said..auto-debit is OFF now..and refund is in progress..n it taked 15-20 working days..for the cheque..
I wonder..why cheque, because it is the same account that they debited from my account using auto-debit facility. Can't they credit into the account..They replied, No, we can credit only if you have paid using credit card..What's the use for customers??
5) And, I was under the impression that atleast by March end, I will be receiving the amount..and
called Metlife on March28th for status enquiry.They replied..we haven't received the acnt statement yet..please provide the same..I was really frustated of this stupid answer..because Auto-debit is OFF...with the written stmt provided by me..and I have also sent the refund req in the same courier..
They say they haven't received refund req..But, I couriered in the same one..
What a stupidity is this..I just shouted at the lady..who answered the call..She asked for courier POD no..I had no number at that time..
And asked to call the branch to which I have sent the courier..Begumpet..Hyderabad..
When I call them, its non-stoply engaged..
Even if I forget sending acnt stmt, because I logged a call, they should remind me, , .No reminder sent..
6) Later in the evening, once again , I couriered all the required documents. This time only refund request..and called Metlife..The guy who lifted..the phone said..the girl who attended the call in the morning..expedited the process..and she will get back to me..he is not saying when will she gets back to me..or with what will she get back to me..
I said..u will once again ask me abt courier POD no..thats it..u will never return my money..pls note down the courier POD no, I said..and have given that..
7) next day, that is today, 29th March, some lady called me..and asked to email the same..I said..anyway..I have sent the courier once again..and I have mailed them the same too..
Should wait for their next response....I want my money back..Its Rs.25000..It may be a less amt for me..but what a stupid process is this?
1) No credit facility..
2) Website never UP.
3) Agent not intimating me..in advance of the Auto-debit..
4) No email faciility...why all written documents..
5) Wrong answers..courier contains..all documents..but lying just to customers..
6) Frustating the customers just playing with their money..
7) Very late feedback..and customer service..
8) Finally, I am eagerly waiting when will I get my money..Its more than 1.5 months that Metlife holded my money..I need with interest..

Way back 2 months I went to my PNB branch sector 11 rohini for Updating my passbook and making a FDR but there was a boy sitting there named upendra told me that interest rate on fdr is very less now so you should explore for other avenues he told me the scheme where I need to invest some amt and it will fetch more than 12 % intt rate it sounds interesting but I had a doubt that why a PNB employee is promoting met life schemes I thought that both companies have tied up so thats why he is promoting the scheme so I gave a cheque and filled other docs as requested he told me to say that I am satisfied when branch mgr asked I did so after some time one of my relative told me the truth that returns are based on market performance so I decided to cancel my bond but I was surprised to know that mr upendra left the job and he was not a PNB employee but an agent of met life designated at branch he fid not tell me while doing the policy so I applied for my policy redemption because upendra told me that I need to invest once only by telling lie infact the policy was yearly where every year I need to invest amt more than 45 days has been passed I did not receive my amt on 49th day I got only 90 thousand against original investment of rs1 lac when contacted the company they said they deduct service charges etc then I asked branch manager but he told me that he asked me while making policy
My suggestion to all viewers is that never to invest in such a cheat company which cant even clearly display that particular employee is met life employee and provide worst service to customers

This is fraud which is done by PNBMETLIFE, spoiling the name of PNB as well.
I will request every user not to buy any policy from PNBmetlife.
See my complaint letter.
Sub: - Fraud, Forgery and done cheating by PNB Met life -(21448383)
This is to inform you that I Vikramjeet singh has some investment in your company. The cheques got debited my account and after that I have received 1 policy.It was a shock to me when I received calls for subsequent payment .Since I was in no position to pay the amount, these investment have gone into default.The fraud is evident from the fact that the handwriting and signature in the policy document seem to have been forged. This fraud has put me in great financial loss and distress, since I had issued cheque for fixed deposite one time investment only. Your company has done high level of forgery, cheating and fraud in above  mentioned  policy
1.  I have not purchased any life insurance policy, This policy have been sold to me on the cheque taken from me as Fixed deposits.
2.  I was not aware that policy has been issued to me, it was when I checked the details from my bank I came to know that above mentioned policy has been issued .I did't sign any proposal form.None of my family member signed it either.
3.  I have not received any confirmation call from your company before issuance of these policies. The signatures are invalid hence these policies are not valid.
4.  Signature are Forged on all the policy document. All the Payments done by me and the Policy issued without my consent. I want to ask one question . How these people can do this kind of forgery. I want strict Action against the cheater. The occupation details are wrongly mentioned in policies too.


My annual income is not so much that I can pay renewals every year.


The person has assured me that these are FD plans and you will get grunted amount after one year. How can policy issued without my signature.




I came to know that the information given to me was not correct now I came to know that I am holding some new insurance policy and was completly unware about that . These policies were done keeting me in dark due to which is impossible for me. How could your company issued new policies without my congent. It is requested that the money be returned to me with interest. Dear PNB Metlife team, now we do not have any other option to get my money Back in Weeks time and should take Serious action against your Employee.
Expecting Positive response at your end with my Payment back to my account

PNB MET Life cheat of Rs. 50000 frm my creditCard,sarojbvansh,India,1,"Oct 09, 2017 06:23 PM",2002 Views,"( Debit amount of Rs. 50000/- to METLIFE From my Credit Card. I am very socked here and think how can they debit Rs.50000 without any OTP and information to me.)
I went to my PNB branch Hari Nagar for making a FD but there was a lady sitting told me that interest rate on FD is very less now so you should explore for other revenues she told me the scheme where I need to invest some amt and it will fetch more than 12% int. rate. I purchase a policy from PNB METLIFE in 2015. which yearly premium is Rs.50000. 1st Year(2015) I pay amount  from my PNB Bank account and in(2016)  I pay online by HDFC Credit card for only one time this year 2017 .policy is due on May-2017 but due to some financial problem I am not able to pay this amount So I call to costumer care of PNB Metlife and request for close my policy and return my amount. he told me not possible because in policy has 5yr locking period you could not withdraw before 5 years.  not inform me before sale of  policy. but I understand company rules and I told him Ok but I am not pay further any amount to your company.  After that last week when I check my HDFC Credit cards statement here a debit amount of Rs. 50000/- to METLIFE. I am very socked here and think how can they debit Rs.50000 without any OTP and information to me. When I call to metlife he told me last year when you pay your premium with this card so I can withdraw because you can click here for auto debit. I am very sure for that never allow to auto debit. I just invest in this company for saving purpose but Metlife cheat/Fraud with me debit Rs. 50000 from my credit card without any information to me.
My suggestion to all viewers is that never to invest in such a cheat company which can’t even clearly display that particular employee is met life employee and provide worst service to customers. They fool you with promises, by giving wrong messages and promises.
I following up from the agent/customer care -> insurer grieviance cell -> GRO but no one replied to me except the automatic emails, and none has took any steps to help me get my money back, for a long period.

However there have been no positive response /action being taken for resolving the issue. I am looking for proper compensation and resolution for the Financial loss and mental trauma that have been caused by the Insurance company to my Father.
My Dad has incurred loss of 1.25 Lacs(Premiums paid - 3.5 Lacs, Surrender Value - 2.23 Lacs). Policy has been purchased in May 2008 for my Father Mr. Shreegopal Jalan for primary purpose of Investment with good ROI and Insurance as secondary purpose. We have been assured by the Agent that Policy would meet the objective.
However we have not seen any positive returns as promised and have made repeated complaints but there has been no proactive measure or resolution taken by Insurance company.
Kindly do the needful and please assist us in taking this fight against Agents/Companies involved and responsible for Misselling of Wrong Policies/Products and causing Financial Loss ./ Mental trauma to the customer.

Worst Fund Performance by PNB MetLife-NEVER INVEST,mginv09,India,1,"Nov 04, 2015 10:05 AM",12374 Views,"ULIP fund performance of PNB MetLife is worst in industry. The older funds of the company are not even able to beat its own benchmark.
Funds performance of newer funds are not at all impressive. According to its own fund performance report published by metlife on its official site, the older funds in which many of customers like me have invested have not even matching the benchmark performance. And after deducting scores of unnecessary and huge charges on ULIP products, what customer gets is NOTHING.  Metlife should seriously look into the working of its fund managers and try to improve the fund performance which is consistently worst.
I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND NOT TO INVEST IN PNB METLIFE PRODUCTS HAVING WORST FUND PERFORMANCE.
I am also attaching the snapshot of ULIP fund performance published on metlife website.

I have nothing against it,chinna_63in,Jamshedpur India,4,"Aug 24, 2007 11:41 AM",3225 Views,"Many people might feel that since they invested in company ""x"" they should be treated as Gods. Thats not the case. Its just 5 yrs that we have stopped queuing up in LIC office to pay our premiums so that we can save taxes. The agents never to be seen once a policy is sold. Now a days at least there are mailers etc which private cos use.
customer's expectations suddenly started rocketing skyhigh when private cos entered. They expect too much from anyone and if those arent met they rate it poor. What wd they say about LIC when no service was available and one had to run from pillar to post for his own money?
MetLife is the only company which has settled a death claim in 48hrs and there was an article about it in media. The premiums are low and beneficial and the ULIp has so many features that most of the other companies don't have. The housing loan protector is the cheapest in India, term products are again the cheapest in india.  Returns are guarenteed upto 10% pa which no company gives. *What else do u want?
*Am not defending anyone , if the advisor doesnot come to pick a renewaL CHEQUE or any other matter we can understand that they are busy. It becomes our responsibility to remember the dates for renewals cause we buy policies for us and not for the advisor-agent.

PNB Metlife: The Most Fraud Mutual Fund Company,chandank13,New Delhi India,1,"Aug 25, 2016 10:04 PM",9111 Views,"My policy no is 20150315 and I have taken Met Little Star.
It has been 6 years and 9 month since I have been paying Rs 3000/ per month and after a recent visit of one of your relationship manager, I came to know that my fund is not moving at all. I also came to know that that time due to the mere fulfillment and increasing the no of sold policy, this policy was sold to me by the agent.
From last 81 months I have been paying Rs 3000/ per month and the total principal amount is
81 months x 3000= Rs 2, 43, 000/
And my current Fund value is showing only Rs 2, 56, 000/? This means I have gained only Rs 13, 000/ as increment after 7 years?
Is this what I have been paying for in a mutual fund?
If I had invested this money in some other plan, the amount I would have got the twice at least.
My points are:-
1) Just to increase the number of selling they have sold me this dead policy.
2) Their appointed agents( Manju Pillai and her husband Sheshadhri-+91-9810860247) knew all about this, still they sold me this policy just to'eat' commission.
3) The fund manager is not acting well in this policy, in fact there is no fund manager.
4) They have'eaten' allotment commission and other charges on a regular basis, but They haven't given any benefit to your customer(me).
I have wasted my 7 years and what I got in return, absolutely nothing.
The crook agent'Sheshadhri Ramaswami'(+91-9810860247) who had sold me the policy has this facebook id=https://facebook.com/sheshadhri.ramaswami?fref=ts=
Beware of this crook and fraudster agent! I am attaching his photographs for the public!
My Verdict:- Don't ever go with PNB Metlife. They are bunch of crooks and will eat your all money!

Metlife - worth a look with caveats,simpletun,Pune India,3,"Dec 02, 2007 02:05 PM",6218 Views,"I woke up to the strange insecurity posed by the question ""what would happen if I were not around to pay my home loan"". I started scouting for term insurance policies - pure protection policies that come at a minimal charge for the protection.
Naturally I started comparing quotes from various providers since this was one of the easier policies to go for - no frills attached and no fine print to read, since there was no money coming back unless of course in the unfortunate event of the insured's demise.
After a thorough research of several vendors - Tata AIG, ICICI Pru, Metlife, Reliance, SBI, HDFC, Aviva, Bharti AXA,  LIC etc, narrowed down to two observations:
a. all these sites provide a premium calculator on their website but it is important to note some of these quotes include the service tax while some do not. For instance, LIC includes it but does not display it separately, ICICI includes and displays separately while Tata AIG does not include it!
b. Metlife does not charge service tax!
So Metlife it was then for me. I registered for a call back on their website and no one called. Then I called their call center and within 48 hrs, someone did call from their sales department. I met the guy and was provided the letter for medicals etc. Medicals were done and records misplaced. So another round of medicals. Finally policy was issued in more than a month and while I can see the details on the internet, there is still no physical copy available!
So my tips:
a. read magazines - after spending a month on my research, I found that business India had a page that indicated the comparisons and that Metlife was the cheapest!!
b. ensure you understand the applicability of service tax - at 12.36%, it is not an amount to writeoff. Besides, who knows what increments the future budgets will have in this regard
c. when applying, note your application number. You are doomed without it.
d. when you do your medicals, get a written confirmation from the medical place for your records. They will not share the results of the tests but can at least provide you in writing that you did your medicals!
Pros:


efficient call center for support


low cost


simple payment options - they appear to have centers quite widespread and hence easy to drop cheques for payment


website provides good online access to the policy although at this time there is no online payment option available




Cons:
There is supposed to be a financial advisor associated with each customer. I got a policy and it does show me the name of my financial advisor. I have not met or interacted with him though:)
Follow up - there is too much required since no updates are forthcoming. However since the call center is efficient, this is somewhat sweetened

But as a customer please study on google about the products and I suggest strongly do not invest your hard earned money in an insurance company, but take only life cover that is life risk that is all.  Better than insurance company is mutual funds or still better will be invest directly your money into stock market for only only long-term investment by doing research.  But as far as pnb metlife I do not find any big problem as its products are good and in market linked products they offer unlimited switches and you can operate just like trading account and earn good amount of profits from the policy itself.

PNB CHEATER Insurance Ltd.,abhi19july,Kolkata India,1,"Jul 24, 2015 10:06 PM",11047 Views,"It is a known fact that insurance agents resort to blatant lies, mis-selling, as well as pressure tactics(like you need to buy an insurance policy for bank loans, locker, etc.) to meet their sales targets. It does not matter what the customers' requirements are, you can always'trust' an agent to sell the most irrelevant and expensive policy, without any concern for your personal financial plans.
PNB Metlife, however, has gone a step further. They actually encourage their telecallers to defraud existing or former clients, while still not officially breaking the law.
I happen to be a former policy holder of PNB Metlife India. I held a ULIP policy of Metlife, which was surrendered a few months ago, and all payable benefits duly obtained into my bank account through NEFT transfer. My policy no. is 1200900853572. I took out this policy through Axis Bank, and my agent was Mr. Hiranyava Biswas. All of this investment was done through proper channel without any financial irregularities.
However, for the past few months I have received regular phone calls from a person who claims to be a customer care executive of PNB Metlfe India. He apparently knows my name and address details, and also the fact that I am a former client of Metlife. He wanted to know the exact amount of money that I received following the surrender of my ULIP policy. I was a bit suspicious, so I did not give him the details. Next he asked me details about my reasons for taking out a ULIP poilcy and reasons for closing it.
By this time, I was fairly confused and suspicious so I did not discuss everything. Subsequently, this person tried to entice me by saying that one of the Metlife agents, named Niraj Kumar, had forged my signature, and siphoned off some additional benefit of Rs. 35000, to an account of Bank of India, which the company intended to pay me. He apparently tried to convince me that I could possibly claim this benefit somehow. This sounded highly irregular, so I only told him to send me whatever offers or suggestions he had over email(that would also reveal his IP address) to my registered email address.Another irregularity was that he called my alternate mobile number, which was not my personal cellphone number. He never contacted me in my own cellphone number- 9051944272.
The number that he called from is 9136668167. I have used internet resources to verify that this is a MTS connection from Delhi circle. This is also suspicious, because, PNB Metlife is headquartered in Bangalore, not NCR. I have cross-checked this number from the database of all contact nos. of all Metlife branches in Delhi-NCR, and none match with it.
I would have believed that this person is a rogue insurance agent or advisor, acting on the basis of leaked customer information, to offer another insurance policy. However, certain events that followed have convinced me that this person is probably a bonafide Metlife employee, possibly encouraged by his employer or superiors to try off-hand tactics to hardsell a policy.
I contacted the Metlife HQ in Bangalore, and subsequently, their customer service, informing them of this fraud attempt. Firstly, they tried to downplay this issue, instead offering to send an advisor to my address to'suggest' some new policies. When I insisted that I wanted to go ahead with a complaint, they advised me to provide a written complaint at one of their branches, along with self-attested copy of ID proof(imagine the callousness! They will send their agent to customer's home to sell a policy, but when it comes to complaints, let the customer do all the running around). But the strangest thing is, from the very day I made this complaint, this mobile number was unreachable or switched off from the next day. It was obvious that someone had given this caller a warning about my complaint. Metlife never showed any interest in pursuing this issue.
This is even more disgusting now. On 12th September, 2015, I received another call from a number 1203050300 on my mobile no 9830580141. I know Metlife's standard answer to such fraud attempts, so I asked the caller to give proof that he was a Metlife employee.
His answer: My own name My nominee name My address My date of birth All this were correct, an info available only with PNB Metlife.( I later called up PNB Metlife customer care that some agent or employee has leaked these details, which means PNB Metlife is an irresponsible company which cannot secure customer information).
Now I asked the caller to give details about his location and who authorized him to call me.
He repeatedly told me that this was a ""service"" call about a missed ""bonus"".
His details:


Name of Akaash Sharma


Office location Borivoli, Mumbai




I checked the number, it has location of Dadri, Ghaziabad and service provider is Reliance Communications.
Wonderful! Another call from PNB Cheater India Insurance Ltd. This time the details are as follows:


Call to my number 9830580141


Number 1204692300


Caller name(claimed) Amitabh Chaudhuri


Actual location Dadri, Ghaziabad


Service provider is Bharti Airtel


Date is 21st Sep, 2015, around 1:15 pm in the afternoon(probably trying to nail a client before going on lunch break)




The caller claims that he has details about another policy that I took out on 2010( accurately gives me policy number and annual premium value).
I ask for more details for verification, especially First holder name and address, as well as nominee name. Keeps repeating that I missed out on ""bonus"". Finally, I tell this guy that I am looking at the phone number location of Ghaziabad and service provider Airtel. He immediately cuts off.
Go on, Metlife. Tell me none of these numbers belong to you I would love to hear Metlife's explanation about this episode
My question to PNB Metlife is: How come a fraud caller has access to customer details? If I file an FIR and then approach Reliance Communications and Airtel, they will divulge all customer details. I am convinced that the number will be that of a Metlife agent. So how come you people deny your involvement? The only explanation is that you are a fraud company, and use all legal loopholes, isn't it?

PNB-Metlife Insurance Company is a fraud and cheat,come2cnit,Delhi India,1,"Oct 23, 2015 10:46 AM",11408 Views,"I had bought a policy from PNB-Metlife 1.5 years back. It was a mis-selling case from the agents.
After filing a complaint at the Insurance Ombudsman, the court ordered the company to return my money.
Now its been almost 2 months since I have submitted all my documents at their office but not receiving any communication from their side.
When ever I call the helpline, they ask me to drop a mail to the company but the GRO of the company is not replying to any of my communications.
This company is fooling people and all people working in it are trained to simply not help people.
On my part, I would ask all people not to take any policy from PNB-Metlife or be prepared to make your life a hell.

PNB Metlife Mera Term Plan: Nice Experience to buy,jitu255,BHOPAL India,4,"Mar 01, 2016 12:46 PM",13055 Views,"Hi Everyone,
This is my first review on Mouthshut. It is regarding my recently online purchase of Term Insurance of PNB Metlife named as PNB Metlife Mera Term Plan.
I had been tried to review it before taking it, but as this product is comparatively new so there is nothing great, I can found. I had compared features & premium cost of others, & find this plan best suitable for me. As its come with 4 different payout option on affordable premium rates. Few review I had been found, which says that Generally PNB Metlife taken very much time to issuance policy, some time more then a month. So it was a hitch in my mind, but finally I proceed for it.
I had been applied for it on 17th Feb 2016, pay first premium online & on 20th they arrange home visit of a pathologist for all required medical test. He did all test at my home only. & amazingly, which really I was not expecting on 27th Feb 2016 I got a message that your policy has been issued & I received its soft copy over my mail.
Finally it was a great experience to buy it, but still I will 4 stars, because of my concern regarding their customer approach. that's why only I am reducing their one star.
Actually I was expecting at-least a single call from their Customer service dept, who can discuss with me regarding policy benefits & also clarify my concerns. In a scenario where if you mentioned your cell no in any insurance company's website. they will make your life hell, but PNB metlife seems to be least bother about having chit chat with their probable customers. Even after making payment, I had not received a single call from them, which actually I was expecting.
So till now I can conclude it a nice experience, just expecting in future, if required they will not so much lethargic on claim settlement aspects.
Thanks
Jitendra Tripathi.
Bhopal

Met Protect: Quick Processing of Application!,phamitus,Amherst USA,4,"Dec 07, 2010 04:51 PM",6940 Views,"I had a bad experience with ICICI Pru's iProtect online policy because of their bad customer communication and so chose Metlife.I paid premium for Metlife's MetProtect policy online on Nov 11, 2010.  I got the policy in my hand in just 15 days!
Metlife offered me to do my medical tests at a hospital of my choice!  They sent their representative to collect my documents.
Best part of it all was coverage began the day my policy premium was paid (and not from the day the policy is approved as with ICICI Pru iProtect)
I am also able to login on their website and check the status of my policy anytime.
Very good experience so far.

Mental Torcher even after paying 4 years premium!,bantakaldotcom,Karnataka India,1,"Nov 17, 2012 01:07 PM",10367 Views,"I have axis bank account and there in year 2007 one of the bank representative convinced me to take a metlife policy [ met smart plus] saying I have to pay only 3 year premium (which is unit link , ULIP or tax saving policy ). I trusted him and signed everything to get a policy.
After receiving policy certificate and terms details, I came to know some hidden terms like I'm unable to withdraw funds before 3 year (3 year lock period) After 4th year they will deduct surrender charges as per table given below [ from Fund value ]
4th Year -  70%
5th Year -  60%
6th Year -  50%
7th Year -  40%
8th Year -  30%
9th Year -  20%
10th Year - 10
From 11th year onward - nill
For example: if your fund value is Rs 1, 00, 000  in 4th year and if you want money and surrender policy (to withdraw all money ) You will get only Rs 30, 000 !!
what I have done is I paid 3 year premium and then stopped...but metlife customer care keep calling me and explaining to pay premium by saying fund value will grow and stock market is down and it's right time and many other things. But their fund growth is worse, everyone who own their policy knows it and if you want proof, check reviews posted in mouthshut.
They don't explain that why their funds value is not growing? and trying to lure policy holder to invest more money. May be because they don't have sufficient funds to trade? or they give good commissions to the caller who successfully convince the policy holder to invest more money.
Even after saying that I'm not going to invest anymore for many times, today I received call and the representative said new thing to me. which is I just have to approve, and he will remove fund from my policy and pay the premium renewal :) I never heard this kind before.
I hope metlife is not another scam. I'm just waiting to withdraw all funds from my policy. I would love to cut loss and take remaining money instead of investing more in any metlife insurance policy!

Ethical and supportive company,jk143,chennai India,4,"Nov 11, 2005 03:36 PM",4342 Views,"Well commenting on Mr.Nambi's review I dont feel that the quality of service and products is not that very bad as said by nambi,also the rejections could be due to various reasons as ascertained by the company and if his case had been rejected medically means it could be due to his poor health condition.the company has priced its products concsiously keeping in mind the purse of the consumers at the same time providing good quality products and service.so I totally disagree with Mr.nambi bcoz I believe that since his case might have been rejected he is slinging mud on metlife.well metlife is a 137 yr old company and is the 36th position in the fortune 500 list and if their service should be so poor then they would have surely gone with the wind long back ago.
only a company that good management,products and service would have been able to survive this long so I think if there are any personal grievances it should be brought to the notice of the company clearly mentioning the problem.rather than be blunt without clearly stating what the problem.even here Mr.Nambi has not told us what were his problems that he had faced with Metlife.
further more if u have any problems,pls mail  to  pragavan@metlife.com

READY to Lose MONEY! CHOOSE METLIFE!!,karthcs030,"Bangalore, India India",1,"Mar 17, 2014 06:35 PM",8908 Views,"I was wondering if I could give negative ratings in this website, unfortunately it is not possible. Worst ever company I have dealt with, If you are ready to loose the money then opt for Metlife.
I have taken a policy and paid around a premium of 78K when I want to withdraw after 5 years they are I will be getting around 36 K. I went ahead and surrendered the policy, one of the rep has called me to continue the policy as Metlife is still not invested my money.
I was shocked to hear his comment, after 5 Long years they have not even invested my money! Reason given was I have taken the policy in recession time. Then why the hell they have sold policy in recession time.
Fraud company! Never ever buy anything from them.

No tensions for your immediate family members...,bhalpa,Bangalore India,4,"Jul 15, 2008 10:27 AM",3789 Views,"I am a SSE in a MNC, and was never intrested with the insurance plans, because I have lived life everyday. I have already taken two home loans and a car.
One day, my collegue had an heart attack (thank GOD, he is alive!!!), but had to undergo medical treatments which cost him close to abt 10 Lakhs. According to him, all his saving were shelled towards his treatment and now he is building up his savings again.
Thats when I realised that I need to secure my family members. I made up my mind to not to pass on any burden (financial) to my family. That when I came across insurance which was suiting my needs.
I called some insurance agents and had a brief discussion on my situation. But most of the advicers are not capable of explaining the terms and conditions.
Then I met an Advisor in MetLife, I gave him my requirements and he gave me a perfect plan.
After discussing the plan with my family members, decided to take the plan.
So, one day I had a appointment with the advisor and filled the necessary forms and was done. I also had my complete health checkup done and got me and my family insured.
I think each and every person needs to be insured. But before doing so, please make  a list of the liabilties that you have and then take a plan which covers that.
Thanks a lot and happy living.

Subject: Complaint regarding my policy no. 00299860 surrender request fund not released
Dear sir/Madam
Firstly On 24th March 2015 I called to phone no.  0135 6456100 PNB MetLife branch Dehradun but however this phone no. not available and same phone no. 0135 6456100 is updated also on their website http://www.pnbmetlife.com.

He told me surrender request form along original policy documents with necessary copy of ID etc.  Send to address written below:

Phone: 080 - 66006969 / 26438638
Fax: 080-22421970
Pin: 560004
On 24th March 2015 all the necessary documents was send on above address by DTDC courier Tracking No. Z48132606.

GUNADHUAR DEVNAATH interaction ID No. 030254275 same day I was intimated by phone from PNB MetLife that I Have to visit personally to Branch Office Dehradun for my surrender request, I explain them that their Branch office is 65 K.M from the address on my policy and I will have to close my store that you want me to visit your Branch office and asked them why your customer service executive gave me all the wrong information that I can send my surrender request to their head office. They didn't have any answer and they don’t care for this.
On 1st April 2015 in the end I have no choice and disappointing visit to their Branch office DehraDun, where I have explain them all the matter and then again they want me to fulfill their all the formalities for fresh request. They really gave me trouble. Anyway I got receipt regarding for this fresh surrender request also I received email about.
But unfortunately up now 20 April 2015 I have not received any Credit in my Bank Account for my policy no. 00299860 regarding surrender request. Neither any email, SMS, call or latter about the delay of payment. I get tired calling them but there is not any reliable information from their customer service center. My last email to Indiaservice@pnbmetlife.co.in on 15th April 2015 they gave me interaction no. 030-593-092   and my last two phones to customer service center 1- complain or interaction with Mr.  Jairam on 16 April 2015 time 03:57 pm, Complain no. 030595850. And 2- Complain or interaction Anshunan with Mr. 030668418 on 20 April 2015 time 02:37 PM.
Whenever I log my policy on their portal @ metcustomer.metlifeportal.co.in it shows contract surrender
As you see whole matter they totally doing Harassment and this are clearly cheating, fraud.
They must be punished. Hopefully you take action against them and Credit my money in my account with heavy penalty. Because they also have charged me penalty for this contact surrender and now they break their contract not to credit money in my Bank Account under maximum 15 days time period.
I will Appeal to PMO because this is not only my personal matter there are 70% innocent citizen in India.
Looking forward to hear from you soon.

My advice is to stay away from this policy. The marketing people will tell false numbers on the bonus you will get on this policy. They will do the calculation based on 7 to 8% revisonary bonus whereas the actual bonus declared last year 2015-2016 is just 2.3%. Please check the site for the bonus declared against this policy for last few years.

PNB Metlife Saving Plus Plan Fake Recommendation,pnbmetlifefake,India,1,"Nov 09, 2017 10:01 PM",1961 Views,"Dear All,
Writing this review only for the sake of it does not or should not happen to anybody else.
PNB met life agent sold me the Saving Plus Plan policy by solely on fake recommendation.
Agent name: Mr. Ambrish Sharma
Contact Number:+91 9999298177
Code: 99127603
Punjab National Bank Branch Name Rana Pratap Bagh
This guy seat inside PNB Branch and may be the Manager and other official also involve into all this.
He told me Premium Amount will be Rs. 50, 000 and remains same(Rs 50, 000) for subsequent years. But they deducted Rs 52, 250 and from 2nd year premium will be Rs 51, 125. This details has been mentioned in policy which is against the terms and condition mentioned by the agent.
It has been told to me at the time of purchase gross amount I will received after 5 Years would be Rs 4, 80, 000. But this amount is no where mentioned in the policy. It has also been told to me that Policy period will be of 5 years. It was not at all told to me by the agent that only premium will be for 5 years and policy terms will of 10 years.
When I asked agent to revoke my policy he clearly said no for this and told me there is no such provision for this activity. In policy, cancellation terms and condition is given in the document.
Please do not let these kind of fraud people to earn their salary by misusing your hard earnings.

"BIG FRAUD, PNB WASTE BASKET AND MAKING BACKSTAB",girishkarnad007,bangalore India,1,"Sep 24, 2014 05:21 PM",10632 Views,"Hi myself is Girish from Bangalore. it at all if you want to lose money, you better invest in ULIP. the bank PNB met life, is a utterly worst and fraud company, we invested around Rs.30000.00 for anually for 10 years.
We paid Rs.150000.00, whenever I ask the NAV they literally show us negative, and finally I decided to withdraw it. they are denying to give my invested amount of Rs.150000.00 back. So please citizens of India, never ever invest in ULIP of any bank, all are frauds. Be care full with them.

Metlife is the worst performer - not suggestable,prameshu,Hyderabad India,1,"Apr 25, 2012 08:55 PM",6833 Views,"Metlife is the WORST performer. I suggest NOT TO go with this insurance. I paid 36000(12000 X 3) after 6 years the fund value now is 30800. The surrender charges are VERY VERY HIGH. When I tried to surrender my policy, the amount payable to me was shown as: 22000.
My payment for 3 years    = Rs. 36000
Fund value after 6 years  = Rs. 30800
Surrender value now        = Rs. 22000
I STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT TO GO WITH METLIFE.
thanks,
Ramesh.

Pathetic returns,Maryann2003,Mangalore India,1,"Oct 30, 2012 05:57 AM",9926 Views,"I have a metlife policy that I took in 2008 - yearly premium of 25000. All the agent told me is you need to pay for minimum period of 3 years . So I deligently did that ...Paid Rs 75000 and then you may withdraw anytime the money Now I just called to request for policy surrender and they say I will get a return of only 42000Rs. What did they do with the remaining 33, 000Rs of principal - forget the interest .
I asked them to atleast tell me which foolish shares they invested so that I know what they did with my money. Online site does not provide any info. I wish I was not so foolish and simply gone and placed that money in a nationalized bank - atleast I would have got 1, 10, 000Rs minimum.
Very clearly this is not a policy for people who are not interested in high risk markets. I contacted the ppl who I know had taken policies in Metlife....sad to find out that everybody is in the same boat as me.. No other go...instead of bleeding further - I am withdrawing the money and getting done with this looters game. Thanks..

Bad experience,Ani04,Bangalore India,1,"Jun 03, 2016 04:42 PM",10740 Views,"In the webpage the timing of the office shown as 9am - 6pm, but after visiting the branch I realized that the working time is 10am - 3pm.
I travelled 10 km in Bangalore to reach the place about 3.20pm, they told to come again in the next day.
It was very tough to travel 10km in Bangalore and I didn't understand that how come such branch close by 3pm every day and web gave the impression that they are working 9am-6pm daily. horrible.

Worst insurance company i have ever seen,kumar3180,"Allahabad, India India",1,"Jan 20, 2015 06:27 PM",10277 Views,"I had taken a policy from PNB Metlife. I chose this company because of PNB name but situation was completely different. First they told me about some policy which contained mediclaim as well but when I search about it on their website they told me website information in outdated and that I could go with the plan and I foolishly opted the policy.
First, I chose for 5 years payment term and 10 years maturity term and they gave me 10 years payment and 15 years maturity term. Second, they didn't give any mediclaim saying that it was to be provided by some third party company and now they are not working with them. Ok so then I asked to cancel my policy and return my money. First, their customer care didn't tell me that I had to visit their office to cancel my policy and then after 30 days they asked me to visit their office but scenario was changed and they told me my freelook period was over and I couldn't cancel the policy.
And now when I call their customer care, I hear a message that leave your message after beep. I left them messages several times but no response.

Worst insurance company,varigopi,Kottayam India,2,"May 06, 2013 05:17 PM",8058 Views,"Don't think about metlife.... it is the worst company to invest. The people who work for the company is criminals....met life is run by crooks and politicians... it is run by criminals... if you call them after the investment they don't care about you.... people must protest and get rid off this company from INDIA. The crooks and politicians in India invite these kind of multinational companies to rob the poor people of India... this is what Gandhiji's idea?

Metlife sucks and poor customer service,sivabk,Chennai India,1,"Apr 23, 2010 10:15 AM",3980 Views,"I took the policy from Metlife 4 years ago. I have been paying the premium on time on yearly basis. I was thinking I received the Insurance certificate from them. Finally I realized I never received any proof of certificate from them. Also I changed the address recently. It is a huge and humongous effort to change the address thus far. I have asked for fresh certificate by have not received any response from them yet. The beauty of it is I don't even know the status of my plans.
Customer service sucks and stay away from this company.

I lost three lakhs in thier pensin plan,sreekuin,#NAME?,1,"Jun 22, 2011 11:33 AM",3761 Views,"I have joined in Metlife pension plan regular to get 25000 per month from them after my retirement. After paying 2 premium they changed thier policy stating that 25, 000 per month is not guranteed. I could withdraw 1/3rd of the amount balance( after deducting almost 50% in various names) and balance I can deposit in thier pension scheme to get pension, whcih will be based on the premium at that time.
Finally I decided to withdraw from the plan after 3 years of payment about 3.5 Lkahs and the balance is only 75, 000 and I lost 2.5 Lkahs for nothing. It was not share based plan but regular plan. I advice that do not fall prey to the new insurance companies, they are formed to cheat.

"PNB Metlife endowment savings plan, Dn't get trap",bansaltk,India,1,"Dec 09, 2017 04:33 PM",1558 Views,"I am a retired person with the age of 60 years. For the past 30 days I am receiving lot of calls from agents of PNB Metlife Endowment savings plan ensuring me that this plan will get me 10.25% Per annul assured retrain, which I thought is un realistic. I told these agents  that I will invest Rs: 1 Lack per annul I f they can give it in writing from the PNB Metlife On my request the directed me to https://pnbmetlife.com/insurance-plans/savings/endowment-savings.html#parentHori
zontalTab1 which list the premium worses age which in my case for 10 years was 9.71 and then they made me calculate the total return by taking me to the link site http://www.boiaxa-im.com/myplanner/compoundingcalculator.php#top which take me a page Power of Compounding Calculator and ask me to enter the values Amount to be invested: 100000, Expected Annual Rate of Return(%): 10.25,
Periodicity of Payment: Annual, Tenure Of Investment(Years): 10 and the result came out to be Rs 1778303/-. Every think look so attractive, I being a professor of physics from IIT, was still not convinced and told him to give me sum time to study the brochure. when studied the brochure I found that they is no guaranteed bonus and that the table that he showed me was not for the return on the investment rather it was the monthly premium to be paid for every Rs 1000/- of sum insured. So I would request every one to be beware of such fraud agents and will also request the PNB Metlife Group to wan there agents for wrong commitments. for the sake to completeness the name of these agents from Delhi are 1. Mr Arun kumar and Mr R.K VERMA. I will request the investor to be careful as it is your money and to safe guard your money is your own responsibility. In case you need any clarification write your comment and I will replay.

Never go for Metlife,sharmaamit02,gurgaon India,1,"May 17, 2012 08:56 AM",7726 Views,"I have been a Customer with Metlife for Past 4+ years now . I have an insurance plan with Metlife Named Met growth . I am not a good follower of what's happening in the  market . I just want to say that normally we all do an investment or insurance for two reasons
1) To do investment for future and get good returns
2) to get the Tax benifits
However with metlife when I checked  how much is the fund value for the amount I have for past 4+ years I was shocked to see that it was not even half of the amount I have already paid. This is really sad and hurt badly that your hard erned money has gone . Now I am stuck in a situation where I can't surrender the policy as I would not get anything nor I have heart to continue it further as that would just be a waste of money. Metlife Just SUCKS big time and I am helpless . So friends my request to you all never ever think of going with Metlife

Worst website! Down and non-usable for 350 days out of 365 and very slow response from customer service. Never buy ULIP products from them, they really suck! I would really like to see if anyone really liked them. There new website extremely slow and not updated frequently.

I tried multiple times today. I am not sure whether I should continue with smartplus or switch. What's the penalty if they close the fund? Does any smartplus customer knows if they have insurance cover that they promised for 100 years. Why should the fund value be less than the total amount submitted so far. Are they losing money in stock market? Can anyone guide whether we should pay the next premium or close out.

Avoid PNB Metlife,divanab,India,1,"Jun 24, 2015 07:13 AM",9517 Views,"I have/had insurance policies with Kotak, ICICI and Metlife(now PNB Metlife). On 21/05/2015, I surrendered my policy as I was not happy with what they did few months back.
About 3-4 months back, without my consent they  did multiple partial withdrawals and paid-back the premiums for fours years. My fund value reduced by about 1.25 lakhs as they deducted premium allocation charges.
I complained and able to cancel all transactions with some difficulties. It took about a month with more than dozen calls and dozen e-mails. It was very frustrating.  Finally, I decided to surrender the policy and did the same thing on 21-05-2015.
Till now they are not able to pay me the surrender value. They are giving one excuse or the other and passing the time.  Not sure what is happening with PNBM,  I will never buy policy or any other product from them. This is one of the worst companies that I have seen in this sector.  The customer support is very poor. I hope they will resolve their internal issues very soon and clear my payments with INTEREST.
The Summary:  Avoid PNB Metlife and keep an eye on what do they do with your account if you are in premium discontinue mode.

Agents are simply lying attactive schemes to get the high commission. Really Metlife service is very very worst. due to my age without intimation they changed my policy to surrender mode though I paid preoperly for all premiums.I tried to ineract customer care so many times.
They did not even Picked up the phone and couple of times responded with lame reasons. After 4 months of struggle I paind one more permium to reinstate my policy.
My Kind advice to all is do not go for mutual funds especially to private sectors. Since a experience guy here my words and not agents.

It has been 10months now that they haven't paid back to us. Policy is in my father name and they have issue with signature, it has been requested to provide the properly signed form, my father is a government official and he is serving highest designation and he has provided all the request from insurance company, still come back with something new. This is seriously a worst company. I am writing this to inform world not to be fooled/irritated/tortured.

One more worst experience here,vallaree,Mumbai India,1,"Sep 16, 2013 10:58 PM",10139 Views,"I read the reviews below and can add that I am one of those.
6 Years back, their 'advisor' Mr Patwardhan came to us and told many positive things. We foolishly purchased the policy and now repenting.
Thankfully, since we had no experience, we went with the minimum amount 12k(still it's a big amount)...they were expecting us to invest about 1-2 lac/yr...
after 6 yrs, I paid 72k(12k*6)...and my fund value is around 66 k.
Last year talked with the so called 'Advisor' who was out of reach for many years, and now he could be reached as he wanted to sell one more product!!!
He said that we would have switched funds when markets were down, we could have saved our money...he (so called) told that he communicated to many ppl, but my phone was not reachable...all lies I know...
I called their customer service and came to know that if I surrender this time, I might lose some money, so better to continue at least for 5 yrs...
I have switched to preserver(lowest risk, low returns)
Now Its 7th yr/time, I have to pay...and I am confused what to do... Can I recover my loss by continuing for 3-4 years and switching funds?
Anyone knows, what is ""Policy in holiday period""?

MetLife Term Plan,zeiger,Mumbai India,4,"Jan 19, 2009 06:54 PM",6827 Views,"Hello All, I would like to tell you about the MetLife Term Plan that I have taken 2 months ago. It is called MET Suraksha - TA.On searching for various insurance options which give me all 3 of following, I found MetLife the cheapest of all:1. Death Benefit: Rs. 25 Lac2. Accidental Death or Dismemberment: Rs. 10 Lac3. Critical Illness Benefit: Rs. 10 LacVery few plans give all of the 3 above at a less premium and in one policy itself.So I went to their site( http://www.metlife.co.in) and asked for an advisor.An advisor called me in the next 3 days and asked when I would be free to meet him. He was ready to meet me on a Sunday which was rather surprising!He asked me some questions like what I am looking for(Term Plan, not investment) and age etc. so that when he comes to meet me, he can tell me exactly how much premium I might have to pay.He came on time on the Sunday(he also called before he came, to confirm whether I was there or not). He showed me the plan I was looking for and I thought it gave me what I wanted at a cheap premium of just Rs. 680 per month(approx.)After that he showed me benefits of a ULIP plan of MetLife, but I told him I am not interested at all.He filled the Term Insurance form for me, took passport photocopy etc. and told me that in a weeks time, I will get a call to get my medical test done. I told him I would like to do the medical test also on a Sunday, to which he agreed(again!)So after 4 days, he emailed me the medical test confirmation letter and to my surprise, the medical test centre was just 2 minute walk away from my home!I was very happy that everything went as planned. Medical test was done and then in the next 4 days, he sent me an SMS telling my Policy Number and said that I will receive my documents in the next 3 days or so.In the next 3 days, I got the documents. There was not a single mistake in any document and it explained everything properly.He also emailed me an offer to join MetLife as Part Time or Full Time insurance advisor and to earn extra income if I can get anyone else to take policies! This was a good thing for me, although I don't need it now, its a good thing that at least they are offering something in times of recession and giving me some money if I get them insurance policies.All in all, there is no hassle with MetLife as per my experience. I am not sure about how easily they will settle claims if any, but atleast, with their attitude in the beginning, I am sure that they are a genuine insurance company with good ethics.In the policy document, they also gave me a loginID and password so that I can log into their site and view my policy etc.For me, it was a great experience being with MetLife, atleast for the first 2 months.I hope it remains the way it is.Thanks.

Survival Benefit not disbursed,sudhindrashetty,India,1,"Nov 04, 2015 08:01 PM",13655 Views,"This is regarding my policy 00093921. I was supposed to receive the survival benefit of Rs.20K in May2015. I did not receive till August, so I visited my nearest branch. I was asked to submit the request form, policy documents & necessary proof.
I was informed that I would get my money in 15 working days, 2 months passed I did not receive any money. I visited the branch again now they say I need to submit a complaint letter. I called up the toll free number, they say I never submitted any survival request form. I don't know whom to believe I have visited their branch thrice & multiple calls to customer care but no idea when will I get my money back. I have similar policy with LIC I never had to submit any survival request form.
Although LIC is a government organization I have never had any problems with them but Metlife although private I'm really disappointed by their customer service. If getting survival benefit is difficult when I'm still alive how can I expect a claim settlement to be processed after my death, the whole idea of having insurance is defeated. I have decided to visit the branch & surrender the policy .I don't know how difficult that is going to be.

"Worst Insurance Provider, Pathetic ULIP",trevanthkumar,Bangalore India,1,"Oct 18, 2014 05:31 PM",10864 Views,"Revanth from Bangalore. MetSmartPlus Policy Number 00661036 since 2008 @Rs.25000 premium.
1) Any call to customer care will last 20 minutes at least, with no outcome.
2) People in branch are totally unaware of their IT.
3) I submitted request for Partial Withdrawal(PW) and I got confirmation call for policy closure.
4) On 10-Oct-2014, CustomerCare intimates that my PW limit is Rs.55, 000/-
On 18-Oct-2014, settlement department calls me up and first says limit is Rs.(25, 000-40, 000). I first laugh and give the background, then they say Rs.45, 000/-
If you wish to lose your money, just for the sake of TDS, go for it.

Number 1 Fraud Insurance Company,anupamprathor,India,1,"Oct 06, 2016 11:00 AM",7969 Views,"In the first year of my Online Term Policy itself their true face is exposed. No one here seems to be concern about the customers issues and their queries. They just interested in receiving premium amount thats it. In my first policy year itself I am thinking of discontinuing my term policy because of their pathetic services and response. Below is the script of my mail that I have comminicated to their customer service, to their Grievance cell and even to their Grievance Redressal Officer(Taranjit Singh, Associate Director, Customer Services, Operations and Services) but no proper and timely response. Their service standard and way of response all shows that at the time of claiming the Policy benefit, how much pain and problem my nominee will have to go through. Even the statistics shows that how poor they are performing when settling the claim.  I am feeling chated now.
Dear Sir/Madam,
My experience with PNB MetLife is not even satisfactory as far as the handling of the existing customer's queries and concern is concerned. And I am sure mine is not one off case who might have had the same experience with the functioning of the PNB MetLife dedicated team who always needs up to 7 days to answer even for few simple queries. Let me tell you what I experienced.
I wanted to know the process of Adding Riders and the premium for that riders. I called customer care Toll free number and they do not have knowledge regarding the process and the premium. They asked me to send my query to  Indiaservice@pnbmetlife.co.in. I sent mail on 20-Sep-2016, and I got the revert on mail after 8 days on 28-Sep. Unbelievable. Dedicated team has to work so much round the clock for those many days just to figure out the premium amount of my riders. But the process to add the riders still not answered. I sent mail again on 28-Sept to know the process of adding the riders and again the Dedicated Team needs 7 days to answer this and am still waiting. I was frustrated by that time and I decided to visit my nearest branch, which is actually 4 Hrs to and fro from my home. I reached there at 12.15 on 01-Oct-2016 and shocked to know that being Sat, it was closed by 12 noon, this was never mentioned in your website about the branch timings.
I called back to customer care and asked them to arrange a call back from the dedicated team by Monday(03-Sep-2016), otherwise I am unable to continue with the policy because of not getting any information from any where from PNB MetLife.
During all these days, I am getting calls after every alternate days for reminding me the premium due, but never get any call from the so called Dedicated Team to respond to my query. They replied only on mail with only limited information that too after 7-8 days may be because that is their TOT and not bothering at all about customer's time constraint.
Please arrange a call back by Monday(03-Oct-2016) who will have complete knowledge of the process and the premium amount, otherwise I cannot carry on with this policy as I may not get information on time before my next premium date.

My bad experience with Metlife,roshk,Ahmedabad India,2,"Mar 11, 2011 03:42 PM",6832 Views,"Based on reviews of the plan, I applied for MetProtect online term insurance plan for Rs 25 lakhs for a duration of 35 years. I paid the premium by credit card and completed all the documentary requirements. The executives at Metlife even verified that my documents were in order and everything is perfect. 

After a week or so I received a cheque as refund for the premium paid. I was taken by surprise as there was no communication prior to that suggesting that my application was rejected.
I called Metlife and after going through 2 persons, I was told that I would get a call back, which never happened. I called after 3 days and was told that I should email the complaint which I did. 

Now I receive a reply which I think is all gibberish since it doesn't give any reason as to why my application was rejected. I expected a company like Metlife to behave in a more professional manner. Below is the text of my mail conversation with them(last mail first): 


Dear Sangeetha, 

I have read your spiel which doesn't explain anything except that you guys like writing hundreds of words without answering the question. The basic question is why was my application rejected even after your executives collected all documents, took my company's stamp on the payslips, and even extended a welcome call- not once but twice. 


You have mentioned in the below mail that the reasons are mainly financial and medical and decisions are taken based on certain set of conditions. I believe as an applicant I have a right to know which condition I did not meet. Is it so difficult to clearly tell me what went wrong? 

As far as I understand, possible options for the reason could have been: 
1. Inadequate health 
2. Inadequate earnings 
3. Incorrect/incomplete documents 

Vis-a-vis the above three possible reasons that come to my mind: 

1. You never conducted a medical test 
2. I believe I earn well enough to pay your premiums 
3. My documents were absolutely correct and complete and it was verified by your executives too. 

Now I fail to understand how a company like Metlife can be so unprofessional and callous in attiMr_customtakeouter towards customtakeouters/applicants. 

I find your behaviour ridiculous and demeaning; and that is not because you refused my application, but because you refuse to acknowledge the reason and provide a remedy if any. 

I hope somebody responsible enough there reads this. 

Thank you very much. 

Roshan

PNB METLIFE PATHETIC CUSTOMER CARE/,mahesh30,bangalore India,1,"May 28, 2015 05:49 PM",9303 Views,"I have a policy with metlife since Feb2010. Due to some IRDA rules, this policy is no more available . I paid premium 3 year locking period and after that I requested for discontinuance of policy .
This year I planned to reinstate the policy after a gap of  3 years, . I approached their bangalore jayanagar office and they told it will take 4 - 5 working days . But to my surprise it took 3 weeks . I submitted application on 4 th may 2015 along with cheque of INR 75, 000 /-  and they reinstated my policy on 20th may 2015 after rigorous followup only, other wise it would have taken whole year.
as my policy is ULIP, I asked which days NAV will apply to convert my premium to unit. I was told repeatedly by their customer care that it will be the day when they receive the premium amount.  As I can see from my bank statement, INR 75000 got debited on 7th may, so logically 7th may NAV should apply. To my surprise they have applied 20th may NAV, the day my policy got reinstated.
my questions is why did customer care gave false information? and why did they do from 7th May 2015 to 20 th May after withdrawing INR 75000 from my account.
No answers.
what should I do to get these answers, I don't have faith in customer care answers.each one provides different anwers.I am fedup.

PNB MetLife is a number one cheating insurance company. They fool you with promises, by giving wrong messages and promises.
They just want to make money by cheating public.First, I chose for 5 years payment term and 10 years maturity term and they gave me 10 years payment and 15 years maturity term. Second, they didn't give any mediclaim saying that it was to be provided by some third party company and now they are not working with them. Ok so then I asked to cancel my policy and return my money. First, their customer care didn't tell me that I had to visit their office to cancel my policy and then after 30 days they asked me to visit their office but scenario was changed and they told me my freelook period was over and I couldn't cancel the policy.

"Metlife, guess in Top 10 unprofessional companies",daWidoW,Bangalore India,1,"Jan 03, 2010 04:19 PM",4136 Views,"This review is about the unprofessional-ism shown by Metlife and their customer care that I have faced so far, and from what I have seen this can be rated one of the Top 10 unprofessional companies I guess. their attitude and the way issues are handled!


Issues faced initially


Communication


Lost history


Citi bank tie up


Site update and online payment 6. the way things are handled by the customer care


Right from the day I got my policy, I have been having facing lots of issues, I was unable to login for almost 2-3 months since the inception of the policy, however the online payment mode was working simple reason it was disconnected from the login page, so convenient. don't care about customer's login and details but always concerned about the payment coming in! I never got any correspondence either via snail mail nor via email. and nothing on the phone as well. I had to make a thousand calls literally to get them to sort out and this finally worked after escalating it to a couple of levels higher.


i was finally able to login, and find that none of the information that I had given was correctly attached with my login. my phone number was incorrect, mail id was miles apart from what it is and the address I think was missing or wrong! again had to make a lot of calls and was sorted after a long time.


Metlife went on an upgrade of the site and other stuff. well and guess what they had a ""Request History"" which was conveniently erased for their benefit so that they can get away with their issues, an update does not mean tampering with the actuals, does it?


they have a tie up with citibank for online payment, and you need to enter your policy number(every damn time) to make the payment, and every time, I would get an error message saying policy number is invalid! and at this time they had changed the policy number by stripping some initial digits. now they have some 5 fields, which the Metlife customer care people have no clue about and they blame it on Citi(by this time I had already called citi and they obviously have no clue as they are all Metlife specific) and again these people don't even understand English well!


there was another time they went on a site upgrade and the online payment gateway was not functioning, and as usual they have crappy communication, I never got any intimation for the same nor was there any warning on the site either, again very convenient on that. well and the account was suspended as I did not make a payment, well although had tried it several times over a period of 3 days, policy lapsed and talking to customer care is just the same old. no valid response, escalated the issue spoke to this person Anitha, well again no help in fact she was not ready to listen to the issue and didn't help to the least bit!




If you ask me, never go for them. professionalism is equally important and especially being a corp environment should not mean you do not care for the customers!

"Metprotect Wrst cust srvice,false commitmnts,cheat",pkngi,Del India,1,"May 26, 2011 12:39 PM",3306 Views,"I had purchased an online metprotect term insurance plan on 31Mar11, as per call from customer care, they assured me that this is best and cheapest term plan
And as soon as I pay my premium online my life coverage will start though the policy will be issues after required formalities. After 12 days I neither received
Any acknowledgement nor and call from them, though premium was deducted on 31Mar11 only. After repeated followups, someone came to collect the required documents
On 13Apr, 10 days lapsed but no response, when I contacted them on mails, phone call I got reply that my application is under-process. around 25Apr, I got response
That some more documents are required which I shared on 03MAy11, then after repeated followup on mail phone calls I cam to know that my policy will be issued by 20MAy11
Then one fine day when I contacted customer care I was told that my application has been REJECTED, and to know the reason I need to send mail to customer care, what the hell !
On one side their sales team pushed me to purchase policy ASAP since my birthday was in april so after that my premium would increase for entire term due to increase in age, so I purchased
this in hurry, ==now I feel cheated, even if I go to other insurer now in may11, I will be charged comparitively high premium now. Worst customercare, irresponsible attitude,
flase  commitments==... Still I dont know why my policy is rejected ??

Beaten by Branch Head,Rupinder_Singh,New Delhi India,5,"May 13, 2012 02:21 PM",8903 Views,"I was employee of your MetLife India Insurance Co. Ltd. I just got my Termination Letter, but here I am writing this mail not for this matter.
I got my termination letter on 7th may 2012 (that’s a other part). I visited your Co. Branch on 12th May 2012 at 1:30 pm to just handover the office particulars like I-card, locker Key. After handover to Operation Manager that particulars, he told me wait for some minutes. Then I was waiting on reception. There Mr. Anuj Jain (Branch Head) came (1:35 pm) to me & asked for the reason to come office. I update him with the reason softly that I am here just to handover office particulars. Then suddenly he took me to collar & started me give abusive language & told me to go out side of office & stared me beating. There were many visitors around there & Mr. Devraj (Operation Manger) was also present there, I told him please save me but he do nothing. I have no chance to defence me. I explained anuj jain that I am not speaking you any wrong words, but he continues beating me with abusive language even out side of the office in stairs going down. He also told other employees to help him to beat me. I got injured in my finger, pain on my hand/shoulder/head also. That’s the Silver I got from your Co.
I called up HR mangers but in vain, Mr. Sushant Rajput (Delhi Head), he told me that, “ you are a Visitor not employee for your Co. now.
He is helpless in this matter.
After waiting any help from Co. Then I called up Police. There Mr. Anuj Jain (Branch Head) came there with some employees who were not present in office that time & operation Manager Mr. Devraj. They all telling lie in front of police, that there was no incident happen like this in branch. I said to Mr. Devraj (Operation Manger)  please be afraid of GOD & say truth but, he told that he did not want to be terminated his job. Police took me to Medical checkups. Mr. Anuj Jain washed all this by using his resources/bribe & feeling in comfort.
I have no hope from any one. They all have a unity; no one is listing my voice. But I will not leave this matter. I may go to Labour Court, NGOs & Human Rights Department also.
Yours truly,

Inefficient Ways,lizthomas,Mumbai India,1,"Apr 02, 2014 07:15 PM",8907 Views,"I had high hopes with Metlife when it came into the market in 2007. I bought a unit linked policy and after 7 years I lost Rs. 50, 000- surrendered this 10 year policy after 7 years as I was losing money. They will keep telling you not to surrender even though you are losing money.
No advice given in the last 7 years whatsoever.
Once they hook you to take a policy, there is no help or assistance throughout the term of the policy.
When you want to surrender, they will make all sorts of promises to make you take another useless policy and they take more than 2 months to return your money after they have declined your policy for no valid reason.
PNB Metlife just wants to PLAY with your money. They are not doing any REAL insurance but  some play with customer's money in the guise of policies!
I don't know what the deal is in PNB Metlife India but it is NOT what it says it is. My experience has been horrendous to say the least.

Said it was best policy but i lost 300000,yomouth,Bangalore India,1,"Mar 13, 2012 10:17 AM",7020 Views,"The agent presented the policy saying, met magic was the best for me and I can pay just one payment and withdraw after 3 years if I wanted. he did not tell me more than 75% of my money is going to the fees and charges. Now I paid 300000 for 2 years and if I were to withdraw now I will get only 30000 only, 90% my money is used for the fees and others hidden charges which I was not aware. if a customer is told about these charges no one in his right mind will buy these policies with their hard earned money. Truly one of the worst company to deal with, it should be called not met life but met death.

Great experience while taking policy,karthikraz9715,salem India,5,"Jan 30, 2016 07:54 PM",14307 Views,"Before my decision for my additional term insurance. I reviewed various online insurance policy from different companies operating in India.
I found that adviser of PNB MetLife Insurance are very good in understanding my requirements and providing appropriate customized offer.
Although, claim settlement ratio is comparatively low at this moment but it is true for all those companies who brought online policies in the market 10 yrs ago. Now, those companies are showing their high claim settlement ratio due to bigger customer base built over period of time. I believe that PNB MetLife Insurance will also be like that in due course of time hence decided to go with this insurance company.
My experience with PNB MetLife Insurance is really good. After my online application and payment, Medical Check up immediately arranged as per my convenience and got policy within 10 days time.
In the entire process, I got assistance of adviser whenever I needed that.
Overall great experience.

#Fraudulent-PNBMetlife,sbav29,Hyderabad India,1,"May 11, 2016 05:04 PM",10446 Views,"May 25th 2016 - Update:
After dozens of calls, multiple email escalations and few social network reviews, I have received the basic information regarding the refund. It took nearly 20+ calendar days to get this basic information.
One thing that I have to praise here is, in all my interactions customer service representatives always  admitted to the deficiencies they have and understood the customer(my) pain.
I really hope, going forward, PNBMetlife will change its processes and systems to improve their customer interactions and not to put the onus on the customers to prove the things that they are responsible for.
Now I will have to chase the credit card company to locate the transaction and I will do it.

May 18th 2016 - Update:
No progress so far. I had contacted customer service few more times and still they do not give out any details regarding refund but still claim that the refund had been issued.
I had followed up with Grievance cell multiple times and absolutely NO RESPONSE. Now I wonder why they had created this cell in the first place? It can't be a Grievance cell it should be called as Black Hole Cell. All emails just go into space.
On funnier side,  even today #Fraud-PNBMetlife web site shows that my is still under review.
I literally begged the customer service reps to open up a fraud case internally against the refunds processing department and NO ONE wants to do it.
Customers please beware of this #Fraud-PNBMetlife.

I had applied for PNBMetlife term life insurance on 29th July 2015 at their online website [url]https://pnbmetlife.com[/url]. I had paid the premium for the policy on the same day through credit card. I was asked to upload documents and attended a medical exam in the first week of August 2015.
This is when the problem started. I tried following up PNBMetlife at their website and customer service(both IVR and email) multiple times to check the status of application. Each time I either received no response or the application under review. Even today website shows that the application is under review. On October 21st 2015, PNBMetlife customer service responded to one of my emails suggesting that the policy was declined with no reason given and they requested some more time to process the refund. This happened nearly 7 months ago. I still(as of 11/5/16) have not received a refund.
When I followed with PNB beginning of May 2016, this time I was given a surprise response that the policy money was refunded as soon as the policy was declined. When I asked for the date & time money was refunded, I had received the following responses.


Money was refunded in August 2015 itself as soon as policy declined.


When I referred the customer service to look at the email sent on Oct 21st 2015, they changed the refunded date to October.


In subsequent calls, I was told the money was refunded anywhere between August'15 through Jan 2016.




I challenged the customer service to give me the exact refund date and transaction number. I got the response that this information(Transaction number and date of refund) can not be given. I escalated to their floor supervisor and it is the same behavior. On funnier side, one customer representative told me that the amount was refunded on the same day it was collected on July 29th 2015.
On top of this, now #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife  is asking me to prove that I had not received the refund. They are suggesting me to handover credit card statements for the period beginning August 2015. I was shocked to hear this ask. I had challenged this by giving the following reasons.


When and where in the world a seller(#Fraudulent-PNBMetlife) assumes no responsibility in providing the refund processing information and it became customer's full responsibility?


Asking for credit card statements is against the privacy laws. I explained that this request shouldn't be made without providing any information from the #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife  side. 8+ months of credit card statements include lot of personal information which I have no trust in handing it over to #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife.


My bank charges up to 150 rupees for each month credit card statement. Who is going to pay for this? #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife certainly does not want to pay for this and customer service representatives confirmed this.




Each and every customer representative that I spoke to understands and agrees with these reasons and promised to get back in their respective first conversations. They promised to get back with this information and till today no one provided the refund details. In subsequent conversations, all of these members come back and tell me to prove that I have not received the refund.
When asked what if the credit card statements don't have the refund transaction, do they(#Fraudulent-PNBMetlife) not ask for any other bank statements? When I asked this question, no one responded and leaving this as a possibility.
I had escalated this to #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife grievance cell level 1 by writing an email to'india_grievancecell@pnbmetlife.co.in' and requested their help. As expected, till today no response.
Then I had escalated this to #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife grievance cell level 2 by writing an email addressing to Taranjit Singh - Associate Director, Customer Services, Operations and Services, email@ [email]gro@pnbmetlife.co.in[/email]. I had received no response. I requested at least an acknowledgement on receipt of email, but no response.
In looking at all these, I suspect there may be fraudulent activities happening at #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife. They collect money from customers and claim that they have refunded. I demand #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife company to inquire and expose this fraud.
Customers please beware of this #Fraudulent-PNBMetlife.

THINK BEFORE TAKE A PLAN,palikadada,Vijayawada India,2,"Mar 07, 2007 10:10 AM",3992 Views,"As per as my experience with METLIFE is concern i.e, customer service and staff attitude is not  upto the standards of private and corporate sector, behaves like public sector companies.Even in product range also there is no innovative plans (even though there is a one, it has its own setback and its limitations).Rates/premium are ok.Thank god I have not witnessed any settlements.The most importent thing is NO BRAND IMAGE.
Over all thing is company has to change in so many aspects like customer service, staff attitude, and look in to other private insurence companies branding and should try to match with them.
The main problum with METLIFE i.e, the Indian partners of this company is not well known and they don't have personnal image in INDIA .So trying to get establish in India may take its own time , by that market may get occupaid by other competeters and useally this people has to go for mergings
SINCE HAVING STRONG FINANCIAL SUPPORT. Why can't this company should go for more adds like other companies to get their brand image I don't understand.Company has to realise BRANDING is very very importent get good market share in INDIA.BIG HEADS of this company how could they ignore this fact really I don't understand.

Customer service sure needs improvement,dshirvaikar,Mumbai India,2,"Oct 08, 2011 05:30 PM",5641 Views,"I bought Metprotect on 28th Sept '11 online and got a call on 1st Oct' 11 from their B'lore centre. But after promising that their vendor will call me to collect the documents and for the medical test, nothing happened for a week. Only when I called them today on 8th Oct, did their rep. call me back and has promised me that the doc  collection and test will be done shortly. Let's see how it goes.
When I asked them why no one had bothered to call me the whole week, I got a lame excuse that they tried calling but my mobile was not reachable. Surely they could have called my residence landline?
Keeping my fingers crossed for the next week.

What we want from Insurance?,sanjay_verma1976,Delhi India,4,"Aug 05, 2008 12:05 PM",3956 Views,"One very important aspect we forget about Insurance Co. is it's credibility to settle claims. We focus much on Branding and Advertisements and Agent's promptness to collect premium
As per my personal experience for claim settlement Metlife is the most ethical company. There was an unfortunate incident in my cousin's family. Uncle had total 3 Insurance plans from different companies. Out of which Metlife settlement was the most hassle free and Prompt. The settlement process is still awaited from rest of the 2 companies and it's already been more than 4 months.
I personally feel the first criteria of choosing insurance company should be based on it's ethical practice and credibility  to settle claims
Anyways it’s a personal decision to choose the Insurer, but I am sharing my experience because I  have seen the pain my Aunty is going through to get her claim settled from rest of the companies.
What we ultimately want is that our near and dear ones should not suffer in case of unfortunate incidents. That's the whole point of getting insured.

Does Metlife know about your review,Nambi100,Pune INDIA,1,"Oct 07, 2005 05:42 PM",3953 Views,"This is an insurance advertisement and has been put on a public medium presumably without authority. I think MS should note what the members are putting on the site. Insurance advt cannot be put without approval of IRDA made on the specific application of the Inusrance Co.
Applicable law is IRDA (Discloure & Advt) Regulations and related rules and this can possibly create problem for MS also.
Coming to Metlife specifically, my experience with them have been very dismal. TAT to let the customer know about issues is absurdly high. Would never recomend Metlife to a person whom I should be seeing for the rest of my life. The branches have no idea what their HO does and underwiters give the most absurd reasons for rejecting applications. There is no concern for the time of the customer. Product pricing is low compared to othre insurers, but quality is also low.

NAV and funds,jjkk123,Bangalore India,1,"Apr 05, 2010 02:38 PM",3683 Views,"I have a policy in metlife but I regret for taking one. The ULIP Fund plan(Universal fund) was claimed to be the best in 2006 but now they say the fund is dead and the NAV is too low that I lost ~12k of what I paid. Apart from this, they are not allowing me to surrender my policy too and I have to lose another 14k if I have to surrender. This is the first policy I have taken but I had such a worst experience with the service and product.
After 3 years of investment, I have to lose around 25k.

PNB MetLife life insurance bad experience,anwarshekh1111,Jaipur  India,2,"Oct 29, 2016 01:37 AM",6696 Views,"Hi companions A study by prevalent life guarantor PNB MetLife has tossed another light on how representatives see and yearning their life coverage plans. PNB MetLife is a main swindling insurance agency. They trick you with guarantees, by giving incorrectly messages and guarantees. They simply need to profit by bamboozling public.First, I decided for a long time installment term and 10 years development term and they gave me 10 years installment and 15 years development term. Second, they didn't give any mediclaim saying that it was to be given by some outsider organization and now they are not working with them. ULIP finance execution of PNB MetLife is most exceedingly bad in industry. The more seasoned assets of the organization are not in any case ready to beat its own particular benchmark. Stores execution of fresher assets are not under any condition noteworthy. As per its own particular reserve execution report distributed by metlife on its official site, the more established supports in which huge numbers of clients like me have contributed have not by any means coordinating the benchmark execution. Dislike this insurance agency awful experience exercise in futility.

MetLife - Good advice bad service,surya1972,Thane India,2,"Mar 03, 2006 06:49 PM",9043 Views,"I am not a person who would normally write reviews on products or give advice on anything, but insurance is a different matter.
I would like to share my experiences with MetLife in the best way I can put forward.
I was approached by an insurance advisor from MetLife (Mumbai) about a year back. She understood my financial needs and gave me a good advice on which plan to choose for my insurance needs. I have insurances with LIC and was skeptical about going in for a private company, however the advisor was very convincing and genuine and I decided to go for it.
Everything was promply done. I was quite happy with the services provided by the advisor.
During the month of July after the floods in Mumbai I realised that my cheque for premium was not realised and I got worried. Later I got a notice from Metlife that my premium was overdue. I immediately got in touch with my advisor. She spoke to her Bangalore office and I got a call from the customer service executive.  Looks like the cheque was damaged due to floods ( they could have informed me but NO I had to follow up) . I resend a fresh cheque again to Metlife.
Being mostly travelling I tend to forget my due dates in which case the premium reminder notices are very useful. Metlife for some unknown reasons stopped sending me reminder notices and my bad luck the advisor resigned from the company. In Feb 2006 I realised that my premiums were due and wrote a email to Metlife asking the reasons for not sending a reminder notice either thru courier, email or an SMS. I was shocked to know that my policy was lapsed and Metlife did'nt feel it necessary to inform me on the same. And the reason given was my delayed payment ( which was no way my fault) and not paying 1 premium (again no reminder notice).
I strongly feel that Metlife has not lived upto the expectations here. If they cannot update their clients that the policy has lapsed, I really don't know how will they act when there is a claim put forward to them. I really have doubts here about MetLife's efficiency.
I give utmost importance to good service. I have decided not to renew my policy with MetLife ( will lose around 6,000 Rs of premium paid) and not to go for any private insurance companies at present.
I have now taken up new policies with LIC. The good part is the agent is very reliable ( as he depends on commisions for his earnings and is a full time agent) and secondly I have a policy taken 10 yrs back from LIC and they have till date promptly send me reminder notices. Also the staff at the LIC Branch ( Borivli W) are very helpful.
I don't have a positive feelings about these private companies when it comes to insurance, Maybe they are new in the business and will take time to stabilize their operations. anyway for me it is NO PRIVATE FIRMS FOR INSURANCE & BANKING NEEDS.

Never go for PNB Metlife Met Smart Platinum,Prasenjitsen09,New Delhi India,1,"Jun 22, 2016 04:24 PM",11271 Views,"I had taken a plan called PNB Met Smart Platinum .
Last year.the premium is 50K per annuam. The agent said that there will be a growth of 12-13% on the invested money.
But as on date I am sitting with a loss of 20% on the invested amount. This is really ridiculous. Even if I had kept the money in savings account I would have earned 4% interest.
I am completely pissed off with the performance of the product. I dont know what to do know. every time you call customer   care they will say this is a market linked program and you have incurred loss.

Go for PNBMetlife Without any Hesitation,smartindian2014,"Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu India",5,"Apr 21, 2014 11:22 AM",9490 Views,"I took a Met smart Platinum policy from PNB Metlife Insurance, with a premium of 100, 000 Rs per year, and my policy number was 20942459. After I was pink slipped from my job, I could not continue my premium amount and when asked the office, I was told that I can withdraw only after 5 years.
After 5 years, I was astonished to get a cheque of more than the double the amount which I has paid as premium. I was making a hue and cry about the PNB Metlife that my money was gone in my earlier blogs.
I should confess that I was wrong and I misled people. My happiness is now no bounds and I strongly recommend people to invest in PNB Metlife Insurance. Thanks.

Have Not Heard Any Good About This!,rockstarksb123,Delhi India,1,"Nov 09, 2016 05:40 PM",9202 Views,"PNB is one of the major public sector banks in India and one of the trusted ones too( because we Indians trust anything funded by govt. blindly!). Around two years ago, one of my close friends took a PNB Met Smart Platinum for the growth of his investments. Leave alone the growth factor, his investments did not even break even.
He had to pay around INR 50k per annum and he was assured of a return of around 13% p.a. He gladly invested in the scheme, however, the results were entirely different. After two years, he had made a loss of more than 20 percent, instead of any gains on the investment. The adviser kept on harping the markets-down beat, whereas my own investments had grown significantly in these two years. Adding to that, the expense ratio and other hidden charges were charged in spite of my friend's portfolio being in a huge loss.
He contacted the customer care executive for lodging the complaint, however, the number was always busy. However, he kept on getting reminder calls from the company to keep investing in the scheme for profit! He visited the local branch for the loss he incurred on the investments. The officials did not pay heed to his complaints. Finally, he had to abandon the scheme and bear all the losses.
In sum, do not go for the PNB Insurance schemes. The fund managers are inept, the support staff indifferent and the services poor.

Metlife- A bad experience while paying premium,Shankar_attapur,Hyderabad India,1,"Feb 04, 2012 10:38 PM",9022 Views,"I have taken term plan from Metlife(plan name is Met Suraksha) in 2007 and my policy no is 00261148. At that time premium offered by metlife was more competitive(source Outlook Money) so I went ahead with this policy. However in general my experience with metlife is not so good in terms of customer support is concerned.
In first week of Jan 2012 I applied for ECS mode payment at Begumpet office. I was told by the executive that It takes around 25 days for the process the ECS mandate application so you may have to pay the premium manually as my premium due date is 24th Jan and ECS will be effective from next year i.e 2013.(I have opted for annual premium).  However executive advised me to wait for 1-2 days after my due date and if my premium is not deducted  then only I should pay manually.
I waited till 26th evening and premium wasn't deducted via ECS so I paid online assuming that ECS will be effective from 2013.
On 31st Jan I saw in my bank statement that another premium was deducted with the same amount by Metlife. I immediately wrote mail to customer care and got an auto generated mail that they will revert back to me in next 4 days. I was impatient and immediately called to customer care. Talked to an executive. I explained him the problem but his attitude was not customer friendly. He told me that since amount has been deducted today from my bank and money has not been realized by metlife so he can't do anything. I was begging him like anything to know why did you deduct money, can you take advance request to refund my money. But to no avail, he was adamant since money is not realized, I can not rely on your statement that metlife has deducted money from your account, you should call us after 2-3 days then they can take a request to refund the money. I again insisted to show him my bank account statement but he was not ready to listen anything. I was totally helpless as I needed that money(Its Rs 10257) for some other purpose. I felt like I am not with the right Insurance company who is so insensitive about his customer. At least he could have verified whether ECS was triggered from metlife or not and could have taken advance request to refund money. But no Metlife is not bothered and he is free to deduct money from your account:(.
Exactly after 3 days(on 3rd Feb) I got another shock when metlife has deducted premium second time through ECS. In total they had three premium paid i.e they have deducted premium till 2014. Out of frustration I called to customer care and narrated the entire story. To my dismay executive refused to acknowledge that there is any extra premium paid to metlife. He was claiming that as on 3rd he can see only one premium paid which is on 26th Jan, remaining s aren't realized and not reflected in their system. In total they have deducted a total of Rs 20000 extra from my account and they are refusing to acknowledge it. They are insisting me to call after 2-3 days. I went into argument mode and told that you guys are telling lie.
I challenged him to see my bank account statement and then make a claim that Metlife has not deducted any extra money. But the executive sounded like a goonda and not ready to listen anything and we agreed to end the conversation. Not sure how soon I shall be getting my excess premium paid back to my account. I have also written mails to customer care, their grievances cell with account statement but haven't received any communication back as yet.
Overall this was a very bad experience with Metlife and thinking of discontinuing the policy from next year.
Feb 22-2012:
After writing many mails to customer care and GRO, I got one of my premium refunded on 16th Feb 2012.Still Metlife has one excess premium with them. Grievance officer named Gita is claiming that matter is closed and if I am not happy with the response then approach to IRDA. Quite frustrating.  I have written mail to IRDA and also to GRO(Metlife). If anybody can help me with what legal option do I have to get my money back and to get proper compensation for the harassment done by Metlife, that would be great.

Fraud company with 3rd grade fund managers,hemant_israni,mumbai India,1,"Oct 09, 2015 12:41 PM",9046 Views,"7 years, investment of 100, 000/- current value 114, 000/-
I have chosen to invest in protector fund which is supposed to be most secure but the fund is returning less than 2%. When I asked customer care why so low they said we don't have that info. All of their polices have 10 year lockin period and penalties are massive.  Their only goal is to fill their own coffers and fleece people out of their hard earned money.
If I understand correctly a protector fund should generate a minimum of 7.5% return. In most cases they are passing on only 1.75% to their customers so either their fund managers are incompetent or they cheat customers out of 6% per annum and dont allow them to exit cause.
ADVICE: Choose some other policy that has some credibility and decent track record. DO NOT BUY METLIFE EVER

Metlife online insurance application,adaniel,Bangalore India,3,"Nov 12, 2010 11:29 AM",5423 Views,"The following was my original post regarding a bad experience I had with Metlife's online insurance. Since then my problem has been fixed. Read the comments section to follow the whole story. Hope this helps others!
-Anand
Hi,
After shopping around online fo Term insurance, I came across Metlife's online insurance application(metlife.co.in) and applied for it on Nov 8th(going through their full application process and online netbanking payment option). I checked and my bank account was debited for the amount mentioned in the Metlife application. But since then(5 days now) I have not received any communication from them. When I login to their application system it shows that I still owe money. I have been calling on a daily basis and they keep telling it will be resolved very soon and I haven't even received a confirmation via email/phone about even my complaints. I finally submitted an online complaint and got a notification that the complaint was received. But still no sign of either the application being processed or money being returned. I will NEVER go with such a company for my insurance policy. If the customer service is so bad before getting the policy how will it be afterwards. I now need to figure out how to get them to reimburse my money. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Don't fall for their online application. Feels like a scam. They don't seem to have the fulfillment of the online application worked out. They only have figured out how to collect info and money. If any of you have had good experiences with the online application, please do share. But mine has been horrible.

Very friendly agents,Reshu1981,Hyderabad India,4,"Oct 21, 2015 11:16 PM",10617 Views,"I am not reviewing the actual insurance policies MetLife provides. This review is about the agents instead. I had a problem with my insurance policy and walked into PNB Metlife office around March 2015. Hyderabad -> Rajbhavan road office. I was prepared to have a poor customer service judging by my policy features, but to my surprise the agent there listened to our issues and he promptly setup to do what we wanted.
The agent's name is Ashok and he was a very friendly person who understands the customer's issues and suggests a solution. Not only that he went ahead and initiated the solution and promptly followed up with us on the documentation and made sure that the whole process is easy on us. I was pregnant that time and he was considerate enough to reduce my in-person visits to their office. Well, our work was completed with in the SLA he has promised. Thank you Ashok. I wish there were more people like you at some of the big named banks and financial institutions.

My worst exp with metlife,kalyan_423,bangalore India,1,"Feb 20, 2011 02:58 AM",3247 Views,"This is one of the worst polices that I had never seen, please ask all the req questions before taking policy with metlife, I had taken policy 3 years back with metlife (2 polices) and I am paying monthly 7 thousands for metlife and the lockin period is 3 years and when I am new to this policy I don't have any information and the guy came to me he told all pros about metlife but not cons, now I came to know what are all the disadvantages of this policy, I thought as my lock in period I can with draw my funds and I was shocked to heard that if I want to take now I need to pay penalty of 70%(this will reduce from every year 60, 50 like that) off my first months premium which is the worst and no insurance company is charging this kind of thing, if I need to take my funds back I need to wait for 7 more years which is the worst thing and they will give the funds with respect to market value of today but not with highest nav (which majority of companies are providing this feature), and when I asked the guy who had taken policy from me he is telling no body will tell a front  all this kind of things which is the worst thing.
Friends, I am requesting you not to go for metlife, please please.........

PNB  a Fraud Co Need my refund with interest!!!!!,anayyar73,Gurgaon India,1,"Jan 30, 2016 03:55 PM",12262 Views,"I am an existing customer with PNB MET LIFE INDIA INSU CO LTD and got couple of policy
I had applied for another policy with PNB MET LIFE INDIA INSU CO LTD and made payment of Rs 20000 thru cheque on 02/09/2015.
I did not received my policy for so many months, when I called their customer support then  they mentioned that policy 21667363 was issued and document was sent on my address.
after so many email followups I have been told that policy was returned to them due to wrong address.
this was an absurd excuse given by Pnbmetlife, I am residing at same address for last many years and also an existing customer with pnb then how come they give such a louse excuse.
Now they are forcing me to accept this policy by sending document in January.
I do not want to accept this late policy and want my refund with an interest.
I am constantly following on email with them, but not getting an appropriate response.

Very good insurance company,shishirbn,bangalore india,5,"Jan 17, 2008 12:32 PM",6936 Views,"HI,
recently when I wanted to have an insurance to cover up my home loan I was faced with many questions and doubts. I am an investor in mutual fund but ULIPs I had a doubt that they will suck all your money which you pay as premiums. But after taking a huge home loan I had to go for this rather than the conventional endowment policy which I had to pay for more than 15 years of 20K premium for a sum assurance of 5lac. But in metlife trhey have a ULIp policy called SMAT PLUS where they give max of 80-90 times the premium as sum assured. For ex if you pay a yearly premium of 25K then sum assured will be 22.5lac. This is worth a policy to check out and u will have to pay for 3 years(25K) and the life will be covered upto 90yrs. If someother happens to the insurere then the sum assured of 22.5 lac will be give to the nominee and also the units wat u get for 25k for 3 yrs. This is a wonderful policy and I fell people can go for this.
The thinsg is like about this insurance company are
Pros:
-> efficient call center for support
->low cost
-> simple payment options - they appear to have centers quite widespread and hence easy to drop cheques for payment
-> website provides good online access to the policy although at this time there is no online payment option available

"Contradictory words, phrases, figures in policy do",chathayam,Trichy India,1,"Apr 22, 2012 12:10 PM",6619 Views,"I requested a one time policy but issued with Metsmart plus regular premium in 2007 with much contradictions in the documentation. The company denied cancellation of the policy eventhough the contradictory documents received to me after freelook periode. Further for surrender benfit also not complying the policy document terms & conditions in which they committed several mistakes that in favour of me. The GRO of the company vehemently contradicting his versions to not settle the surrender benefit in full and also violating the other clauses of the terms and conditions.
The drastic mistake committed by the company is traeted leaniently whereas if any simple mistake committed by the customer will bve taken very seriously. How judicious?

PNB MET LIFE IS NOT A WORTH TO INVEST,harirampal,"Jaipur, Rajasthan India",1,"May 03, 2018 08:22 PM",383 Views,"Dear All,
Kindly note that my experience with PNB METLIFE is not well. Their Customer care talked today on 3rd May 19:00 hours to 20:00 Hours has not shared me few basic details.
They are not skilled and they dont share you proper information, for every information you ask they will say to reach to Branch.
I am going to discontinue this and hence I recommend you all to Discontinue all your policies from PNB METLIFe.
Certainly their professional service, Their customer care, their return everything is not worth.
Please do not invest your hard earned money in PNB MET LIFe.
Thank you.
Hari

Avoid Metlife  and save your life,boyoboy18,Bangalore India,1,"Oct 12, 2011 11:15 PM",6995 Views,"I took Metlife policy in 2006 and the agent lied about the charges. There are lots of hidden charges. In the past 5 years I have paid more than 10k as policy charges. Due toi all these high hidden charges my fund value has just increased by 1000 rupees in last 5 years.
The biggest pain is that you can exit this policy before 10 years, otherwise you will have to pay high penalties(like 70% of the first premium if you want to exit after 3 years) - Nice way to loot customers and secure their booties.
AVOID IT AND DONT RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.

PNB Metlife - Why i met you ?,hassan_arafat,Noida India,1,"May 27, 2016 12:37 AM",12363 Views,"I applied online for the policy on 24April 2015, and initiated the cancellation of my policy by email on 29th april because I came to know that the agent has lied to me.
I followed the protocol of cancellation - following up from the agent/customer care -> insurer grieviance cell -> GRO but no one replied to me except the automatic emails, and none has took any steps to help me get my money back, for a long period.
Moreover, after lot of days the pnb grieviance cell replies to me with my email edited wrongly and its history removed.
I wonder if these guys can give a headache when the person is alive then I wonder how easy would it be for the family to get money from these people, in case of any unfortunate incident?
My policy details -
policy num 21886999
Application ID: 30812668
Policy name: PNB Metlife's Mera term plan Policy

Need suggestion on PNB Metlife smart platinum,dharmpersonal,India,2,"Feb 23, 2017 05:21 PM",6768 Views,"I would like to know about the percentage return from this policy. However, I have been told that there would be at least 14-15% return per annum on my premium deposit. Is this true?
Secondly, if I deposit 1.00 Lac per year for 10 years, on maturity PNB will pay me 22.50 Lacs
if I deposit 1.00 Lac per year for 15 years, on maturity PNB will pay me 49.98 Lacs
Is this true?
Thirdly, If I keep 125% of money with PNB, my insurance will last till 99 years.
If I can withdraw 50% money and rest opt for pension plan for me and my nominee.
Seriously, after reading the reviews, I am really very much confused rather scared to go for PNB Metlife.
I really, do not wish to block or waste my hard earn money.
Somebody, please clear my doubt and advice. I shall be highly grateful.
Thanks

Never Ever Puchase PNBMETLIFE Policy-FRAUD Company,mrvkm,bangalore India,1,"Feb 06, 2016 01:26 PM",12725 Views,"I generally don't write reviews but metlife pathetic service has forced me to write this review. I thought to share with other persons so they don’t go through the same pain by starting a policy with pnbmetlife.
I had an old pnbmetlife policy from July 2009 which I wanted to cancel due to huge policy handling charges by pnbmetlife. The policy return was extremely low during this 6 year period. One can imagine the quality of fund management there.
To initiate the return, One pnbmetlife agent came to my home and suggested to partial withdraw money from this policy. He also recommended to start a different new policy using withdrawl money(he mentioned new policy has very low charges) and processing will be fast on old policy. He told that pnbmetlife refund department will call me to decide partial withdrawl amount before initiating same. I also provided written communication to pnbmetlife that my old policy should remain active. But these folks refunded an amount so that my 6 year old policy got automatically canceled within 2 week in Nov 2015 after partial withdrawal without any information to me. When inquired, pnbmetlife customer service told that policy is automatically cancelled once fund value reaches below a certain amount. Also pnbmetlife charged Rs 53000 to close the policy which I never wanted to close at first place. They sent a cheque(without informing me) which after 2 and half months they informed me. I have never got any cheque. I applied for cheque block a month back in Jan 2016 and till date cheque block confirmation email has not come to me. There is more than 30 email chain on this policy discussion. Now they are saying that I need to reinstate the policy and pay charges. Last 1 month they are not able to figure out the extra premium I need to pay for re-instantiate the policy. They have not confirmed that I will get all my 53000 Rs cancellation charges reverted to my policy account(that is main reason I want to re-instantiate).
I also started new policy as recommended as I was hard pressed for some other commitments and made this hasting mistake of buying this new policy. Soon noticed that I was mis-sold the new pnbmetlife policy mentioning new features and false low charge values etc. As I knew 15 days lookin period was there, following week, I communicated in email to agent that I will be returning the policy in lookin period even before the policy was sent to me
Agent told that he will come and again explain charges with some other financial terms. But II clearly told him that I need to cancel my policy and do not want to meet again. Then he told that my policy will be cancelled and money will come to my account. When I did not received my policy in 2 weeks I again mailed. Then I was told that policy is returned due to address not correct. It will be sent again. And it again returned back due to same address incorrect reason.
After that email/phone response from agent stopped. I realized it is because I was now returning the policy. In effect this agent just delayed my policy return by 2 months.
Then I sent email to central customer support. Since I didn't got policy document, I got the policy number by phone call to their customer care(18004256969) through my mobile and dob verification. They suggested that I have to go to nearest pnbmetlife office without policy doc for cancellation.
I searched pnboffices and saw many pnbmetlife offices are already shut down across locations in the city. One which was close to my home is also shutdown(it also shows shut down status in google map and pnbMetlife Board is also not there anymore.). I only had option to go to MetLife office 19kms from my home and I went on Sat morning to their office for free look-in cancellation.
Finally a month after going to pnbmetlife office, I got the new policy cancelled within looking period condition. Note that policy got cancelled after 3 months of issue, but since I had emails mentioning that I had communicated about my policy cancellation decision within 15 days of policy issue, so I was able to cancel the policy after 3 months of issue date. I suffered Rs 9873 loss in new policy cancellation since they delayed the refund on my new policy by 2 months by misguiding me on refund process. I am checking on my options for the escalation for this issue.
I realized pnbmetlife is mis-selling and cheat customers providing lot of false info. Their agents are misguiding so free-lookin period is consumed and then customers get trapped in close ended fund of 3 year or 5 year lockin period with mandatory renewal OR lose huge sums of money.  While selling policy they will come to your home and if you decide to return they will not even pick phone or email reply and make you run for our own money. I have wasted lots of time and my mental peace chasing these people since last 3-4 months. You need to personally go to their office so many times for simple things. Don't know for how many more months I need to chase them further.
I would suggest people not to buy policy from this company.
Update - 28th Feb 2016-
This issue is NOT resolved yet. I am still following-up with customer care but haven't received the amount to be deposited to re instantiate the policy. customer care is out of sync with backend team. Customer care was telling earlier(around last week of jan) that it will get amount from backend team next week. I tracked that for 2 weeks. Now they are not responding any email or phone call. Last time when I visited Customer care I was quoted 3 different amounts with very different values and hence I need that info clearly before I visit their customer care and travel 40kms and waste minimum my half day for none of my fault.

NEVER BY METLIFE POLICY,sumi12345,Bangalore India,1,"Jan 17, 2012 12:22 PM",6522 Views,"These people are big time cheats, I took a policy 3 years back, ULIP plan. They said 3 years is my locking period and I can withdraw money after that.
I paid 25k each for 3 years. which should now be 75k. But when I go to withdraw it. They say my policy is for 5 years and also the agent has marked and not conveyed me about many of my charges.
My 75k now is equal to 68 k. and if I withdraw it. they will give me only 58 K.
Its such a huge loss and waste of hard earned money.
Agents cheat for commission and Met life office people are not friendly either. I regret investing my money here.
