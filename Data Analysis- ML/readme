1.Exploratory Data analysis, Mining, Cleaning, Finding correlations and Statistics Analysis between different aspects of data using PYTHON
and libraries like PANDAS, NUMPY, SCIPY, SKLEARN etc, other respective libbraries as required.

2.Preparing datasets for further modeling, to fit to the advance algorithms, to demold dataset to fit into ML and other models

3. Finding and analyzing for different statistics by both pandas and core-python. and to extract the complete essence from datasets.

4.Using the advance libraries sklearn and preprocessing libraries for Data mining, Data analysis, Predictin/ Regression and 
Evaluation of the model are done for different algorithms.
